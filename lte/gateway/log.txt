    [mme] Fixup missing includes in various headers (#5062)
    
    In attempting to build the MME by use of our docker container at ../../../../orc8r/gateway/c/common/config/MConfigLoader.h, I repeatedly ran into build failures due to missing header includes.  After some iteration, the following collection of fixups were necessary to achieve healthy build.
    
    Nearly all were clearly missing headers and made sense.  The exception was unexplainable build failures of bytes_to_ie.c that only resolved after removal of commented-out header includes. I cannot explain that change, but on the other hand it's good cruft to remove regardless.

    Rather than using TC as only source of APN AMBR, use Redis
    to store the qid->APN-qid and APN_leaf->APN info.
    This avoid complicated recovery in stateless mode.
    This PR also adds apn_ambr_enabled config to enable APN AMBR feature.

    AGW: mobilityD: Do not allocate IP in case of static IP allocation error (#4511)
    
    MobilityD tries to allocate static IP, it communicates with
    subscriberDB. If there is any error in getting the info from
    subscriberDB, it continue with ip-pool based allocation.
    This does not work when operator wants to only use static IPs
    this patch changes this behaviour to failed allocation in
    such cases.

    [docker] use `--no-cache-dir` flag to `pip` in dockerfiles to save space (#4178)
    
    using "--no-cache-dir" flag in pip install ,make sure downloaded packages
    by pip don't cached on system . This is a best practice which make sure
    to fetch from repo instead of using local cached one . Further , in case
    of Docker Containers , by restricting caching , we can reduce image size.
    In term of stats , it depends upon the number of python packages
    multiplied by their respective size . e.g for heavy packages with a lot
    of dependencies it reduce a lot by don't caching pip packages.
    
    Further , more detail information can be found at

    coredump already stores zipped core dump in '/var/core/' dir.
    but it could not finish execution due to a bug.
    coredump handler uses 'logfiles.txt" to find log file names.
    but it had 'spgw.log', which no longer exist. removing this file
    fixes the issue.

    * Invalidate the T3849 timer id while processing esm information retransmit
    
    The _esm_information function stops the existing T3849 timer as referenced
    by the esm_ctxt datastructure timer before rescheduling a new T3849 timer
    when it requests for the esm info from a UE.
    Stopping the timer has a side effect of freeing up the UE related
    retransmission data associated with it. This causes issues during
    the T3849 timer expiry handling as the cancelled timer and the rescheduled
    one reuse the same retransmission data datastructure.
    
    Fix this by unsetting the T3849 timer in the handling of the timer expiry
    as the esm_ctxt is not associated with any valid timers anymore. Further
    as the timer is a oneshot timer it will be cleaned up after the processing
    of the timer callback.

    AGW: pipelined: Add logical router for UE traffic. (#3781)
    
    This patch adds support for a router that can be reached from SGi network.
    It would allow operator to configure static route for UE ip block
    on upstream gateway node.
    At this point AGW does not support route advertisement.
    The router only responds to ARP packets for router IP.

    [nms] remove transitive dependencies from flow (#2767)
    
    By doing this, we reduce the number of files flow has to parse
    from ~40k to ~27k.  Since they are used in package-of-packages,
    and we never import those directly, we can safely ignore them
    
    run `flow` before and after this change.  Verify no flow errors, and
    that parsing has sped up

    [SPGW] X2-hand-over: fix gtp-end marker generation (#2444)
    
    upstream OVS has different GTP header field names. This patch
    uses them to avoid error on such OVS with GTP end marker support.
    We will not be using older OVS packages so there is no need
    to maintain any compatibility.
    This patch also adds event logging, That would be useful for
    debugging of-connection related issues.

    temporarily removing tests from sanity (#2056)
    
    Summary:
    Signed-off-by: Ulas Kozat <kozat@fb.com>
    
    Running tests after preamble test s1aptests/test_modify_mme_config_for_sanity.py would lead to getting stuck while running the sanity tests for LTE. The issue seems to be that the restart process for the AGW interferes with the first test scenario after the test s1aptests/test_modify_mme_config_for_sanity.py. Removing the preamble and postamble as well as the tests that require them and moving to a commented out section to revisit later.
    
    As a side note: manually running the preamble and postamble and the test of interest works without any issues.
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/2056
    
    Test Plan: Run `make integ_test` in test_vm under `~/magma/lte/gateway/python/integ_tests` while running the traffic and dev VMs.

    Began styling global dialogs using eNodeB detail edit/add dialog (#2010)
    
    Summary:
    # Overview
    This PR focuses on applying global styles for the various dialogs we use. At the moment this PR is focusing solely on eNodeB detail dialogs, but the global styles are applied throughout magma. Future PR's will align other modals to the design.
    
    ## Dialog Modal
    The global styles for the dialog box itself, including `Backdrop`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogContent`, and `DialogActions` have been added to our default styles and will propagate across the platform. In addition, I've added another option for users to close the modal via a close button in the top right corner.
    
    Input fields have had their styles updated as well to better match that of the design. I've added a new `focus` and `hover` state, as well as removed some of the curve to the corners.

    Selected security algorithms as part of UE Network Capability were not getting applied when passed from test scripts. The issue was observed while analyzing the need to change the MME configuration for security algorithm related test cases. The issue has been fixed and the test cases have been restructured to cover all the encryption/integrity algorithms supported by MME.

    Update CWAG health service to include radius in service health when gateway is active (#2002)
    
    Summary:
    This diff corrects the logic used by the CWAG's health service in determining unhealthy
    services. When a gateway is demoted (disabled), the radius server is stopped. This is
    done to force the WLC to see the RADIUS server as down, thereby re-routing traffic to the
    active.
    
    Previously, the radius service wasn't included in the service health check, since it is always
    stopped on the standby. This diff updates the logic to include the radius server when the gateway
    is active, but continues to not include it when the gateway is a standby.
    
    This logic will be removed shortly when we introduce transport failover, as we will no longer
    intentionally stop the radius server.
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/2002
    
    Test Plan:
    Added unit test.
    Tested locally on CWAG to ensure that when the radius service is stopped:
    -  if the gateway is disabled, it will return healthy
    -  if the gateway is enabled, it will return unhealthy.

    Allow health service GRE endpoints to have CIDR format (#2029)
    
    Summary:
    This PR updates the GRE endpoint parsing logic for the CWAG's health service.
    Currently, the health service only monitors singular IP endpoints (i.e. not subnets).
    However, if an endpoint is of format "10.10.10.10/24" it should be monitored since
    despite having CIDR formatting, it corresponds to a single IP. This PR fixes that logic.

    Migrate all integration tests and publish jobs to opensource circleCI config (#2030)
    
    Summary:
    ## Summary
    
    - Move integ tests and docker publish steps into this repo
    - Some differences from the old internal jobs because we're using a couple different workflows in this config instead of a megaworkflow.
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/2030
    
    Test Plan:
    - https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/facebookincubator/magma?branch=fullcircle
    - There are a few legit failing tests (nms) and cwag integ might flake, but we already got some publish notifications on slack.

    Gateway details config (#1971)
    
    Summary:
    # Overview
    This PR is primarily for updating the Gateway Detail Config page so that is works better, and looks more in-line with the design files.
    
    ## Gateway Details Config Page
    The page originally was running into issues with expanding/collapsing the lists. While resolving that issue, I also updated the components to make better use of our styled components, such as KPI Grid, so as to better match the design files.
    
    #### Before

    Mme s11 abstract (#1986)
    
    Summary:
    This change set adds support for Gtpv2c based S11 interface between MME app and any external SGW/PGW
    *NOTE*: Since inter-task messaging has moved to Zmq, this change set is unstable with `mme` feature
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1986
    
    Test Plan:
    For `agw_of` feature: S1ap integration tests in dev setup
    For `mme` feature: Tested with OAI CUPS SPGW in Eurecom CI with pre-Zmq inter-task messaging

    Update prometheus package
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/
    
    In order to fix some dependency issues, I'm syncing the go.mod file in prometheus-configmanager with magma (see D22604778). However doing that with the current version of prometheus results in a weird issue that I believe is due to running it with go1.13. I'm updating prometheus here which thankfully doesn't cause many other dependency upgrades doesn't cause any test failures.

    - **agw_of**: mme + spgw with ovs datapath + S6a over grpc
    - **agw_gtpnl**: mme + spgw with libgtpnl datapath + S6a over grpc
    - **mme**: only mme, with s11 over gtpv2c and S6a over FreeDiameter
    2. This change adds FreeDiameter support for S6a in the MME service
    3. Further, S1ap utils are also modified to support communication with OAI_HSS (Installation instructions here https://github.com/OPENAIRINTERFACE/openair-cn/wiki/OpenAirSoftwareSupport)
    4. Adds a dev VM with IP address 192.168.60.153 to install OAI HSS for testing S6a over Free Diameter
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1978
    
    Test Plan:
    - Tested agw_of feature with S1ap integration tests
    - Tested S6a over FreeDiameter with OAI HSS VM

    Today AGW adds static route on startup. That makes it hard to change it
    according to mobility ipblock assignment. This patch fixes it, by configuring
    route according to mobilityD configuration.
    This patch also removes IP address from gtp_br0 which is not used.

    Restrict accessible tabs per project
    
    Summary:
    A bug was recently encountered in `magmalte` where if 'Inventory' was selected as an accessible tab, when visiting `https://<org-name>.localhost` the page would fail to load because there is no router entry for inventory paths in magmalte.
    
    Thus, it makes no sense for inventory to be selectable as an option. This applies for all the other tabs that aren't "NMS" (automation, hub, etc.). Until those routers are implemented in magmalte they are useless.
    
    Since projects should be independent of each other, the available tabs should be different for each. This diff allows a prop to be passed to the `OrganizationEdit` so you can specify specific tabs that are accessible. This will have no impact on symphony's deployment, but it restricts `magmalte` to only have "NMS" as a tab option.

    Updated GetState to take in enodebSN rather than hwID (#1967)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1967
    
    Passed in the wrong value to `GetState` which resulted in testcontroller failing on dogfooding. Now passing in enodebSN. Pretext has also been updated to use targeted gateway rather than the traffic gateway

    Add mandatory properties enforcement on close (#892)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/892
    
    Logic for mandatory properties:
    * If no default Value for property type -> should have 1 property with non-empty value
    * If with default Value -> either 1 property with non-empty value or no property at all
    
    Use ent transaction hooks to validate that all mandatory properties exist
    
    Until now there was a logic that says that mandatory properties are on work order creation and not on close, use feature flag to switch between the options.

    added `.gitattributes` file for ability to ignore generated file
    
    Using attributes, you can do things like specify separate merge strategies for individual files or directories in your project, tell Git how to diff non-text files, or have Git filter content before you check it into or out of Git.
    `linguist-generated` - suppress the display of diffs in your pull requests.
    `-diff` - tells git to treat this file like a binary file. The diff output will indicate that the file has changed but won't display the differences.
    `-merge` - tells Git to treat merging like a binary, too. It will accept the latest version and avoid any conflict resolution

    Not much work needed to be done here, but the designs were flattened and the overall top bars were streamlined to match other sections on the site.

    Update flaky indexer test to output error
    
    Summary:
    `TestRun` is flaky, failing ~1/25 tests in CI. I was unable to repro locally, but this diff should provide context the next time the test flakes in CI.
    
    My assumption is it's something to do with the switch to indexing over gRPC -- I think the goroutine starting the service occasionally doesn't get executed before the tests' call to that same indexer servicer, returning an err for the `Index` method. Related line: orc8r/cloud/go/services/state/test_init/test_indexer_servicer.go:40
    
    But we'll wait for the actual error before updating the tests.

    Summary:
    The stateless AGW test cases do not revert the stateless config after the test
    is complete. Running a "stateful" test at the end of the test suite should
    revert all config to "stateful", making it clean to commit the local code
    changes.

    Add grpc connection reuse to CWF operator (#1950)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1950
    
    This diff is a result of issues seen duing CWAG HA
    SIT testing. Previously, we created a new connection for
    each client call to the gateway health service. This has
    shown to be resource intensive which is problematic for
    a variety of reasons (i.e. wasted k8s control plane time,
    longer failovers, etc.)
    
    This diff adds a service connection registry by using
    the existing registry in orc8r/lib. Since k8s services
    are dynamic and external, here we add services on the
    fly.
    
    We set service name to svc:port rather than just
    svc as in theory a gw port could change during runtime.
    This ensures that if this ever occurs, we won't use
    the old connection that no longer works.

    We are still figuring out if we need to add this back or can just
    remove this configuration all together, but for now set the default
    so that upgrades work properly.

    Equipment eNodeB Dashboard/Detail Screens and Gateway Logs (#1940)
    
    Summary:
    # Overview
    This PR covers eNodeB dashboard/detail screens, as well as improvements to the Gateway Logs screen.
    
    ## eNnodeB Dashboard/Detail
    Similarly to [Gateway Dashboard/Detail](https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1934), content is laid out more in-line with the overall design styles and the dashboard leverages the new `KPIGrid` for both the **Overview** and **Status** KPI's.

    #### Navigating to the detail screen.
    ![](https://media.giphy.com/media/L0ePyroTql5w7bLt1J/giphy.gif)
    
    ## Gateway Logs
    Updated the overall layout of the page and added a background card for the graph. This page also makes use of updated global input/button styles for the date/time pickers and export button respectively.

    Replace ITTI messaging with ZMQ
    
    Summary:
    ZMQ replacing ITTI messaging stack
    
    This is the main diff in the stack
    
    This diff uses ZMQ sockets for ipc communication instead of using ITTI
    We use a non-broker based solution. Each task has a PULL socket for receiving all IPC and a number of PUSH sockets depending on how many tasks it needs to communicate with.
    
    We use zloop to manage the sockets as it also provides timer support that we will use later to get rid of ITTI all together.
    
    Main thread communicates with all tasks for termination. But it does not need a PULL socket.
    
    ITTI library is still used to manage timers and signals

    Register state indexers via service registry rather than plugin
    
    Summary:
    As part of removing the plugin architecture, we transition to storing service information in the service registry, rather than via injection during plugin registration.
    
    Eventually, this information will be injected into the service registry via k8s interactions. For now, it's statically set by reading all `service_registry.yml` files.
    
    State indexers are identified by the following
    - State indexer label -- `github.com/magma/state_indexer`
    - State indexer version annotation -- `github.com/magma/state_indexer_version`
    - State indexer types annotation -- `github.com/magma/state_indexer_types`
    
    The differentiation between labels and annotations -- labels are identifying (e.g. "I'm a state indexer"), annotations are key-value storage for a particular service ("this is my state indexer version"). This works well with k8s model of labels+annotations, though we'll have to be a bit hacky with docker-compose since they only support labels (not the end of the world).

    Enforce lowercase service names at method boundaries
    
    Summary:
    The enforcement of all-caps within service registry methods is a bit haphazard at the moment, I was running into some issues and it felt like a great place to prevent future bugs. Also clean up / normalize some code style.
    
    The uppercased service names was a legacy design decision, and was at odds with service naming elsewhere in the codebase. This diff standardizes service names as always lowercase.

    Gateway detail (#1934)
    
    Summary:
    # Overview
    This PR primarily covers individual Equipment Gateway Detail. In addition there has been some work done to universal components, such as `KPIGrid` that make for easier future development.
    
    ## Gateway Dashboard
    Content is laid out more in-line with the overall design styles. In addition the dashboard leverages the new `KPIGrid` for both the **Overview** and **Status** KPI's.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8878152/86169055-08702380-bae7-11ea-8ca7-d30a6cad539f.png)
    
    ## Updated KPI Grid/Device Status
    
    ### KPI Grid
    The KPI Grid now allows you to quickly display KPI's in whichever grid layout you need. See example below:
    
    ```js
    const kpiData: KPIRows[] = [
        [
          {
            category: 'Health',
            value: isEnbHealthy ? 'Good' : 'Bad',
            statusCircle: true,
            status: isEnbHealthy,
          },
          {
            category: 'Transmit Enabled',
            value: enbInfo.enb.config.transmit_enabled ? 'Enabled' : 'Disabled',
            statusCircle: true,
            status: enbInfo.enb.config.transmit_enabled,
          },
        ],
        [
          {
            category: 'Gateway ID',
            value: enbInfo.enb_state.reporting_gateway_id ?? '',
            statusCircle: true,
            status: enbInfo.enb_state.enodeb_connected,
          },
          {
            category: 'Mme Connected',
            value: enbInfo.enb_state.mme_connected ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected',
            statusCircle: false,
            status: enbInfo.enb_state.mme_connected,
          },
        ],
      ];
    ```
    
    You no longer need to worry about setting up the grid, or dealing with `CardHeader`, simply placed each row within an array, and then fill in the proper data.
    
    Each **Row** object can take in the following data:
    * **category** -- (Optional) The label for that specific KPI Box
    * **value** -- The value for that specific KPI Box
    * **statusCircle** -- Whether or not a status indicator should accompany the **value**
    * **status** -- (Optional) Determines whether the status should be active or not
    * **statusInactive** -- (Optional -- default `False`) In the case the status should be inactive (gray), set this to true.
    
    ### Device Status
    Device Status has now been incorporated into our local project as a part of `KPIGrid`, as well as refactored to make positioning more consistent.
    
    See [KPI Grid](#kpi-grid) for information on how to interact with the status indicator.
    
    ## Odds and Ends
    In addition to the overall core changes mentioned above, there have also been some minor style bug fixes throughout the files.

    Add logging of some GRPC messages (#1936)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1936
    
    This diff adds the capability to show some GRPC messages through the log.
    To enable this we just need to set the following var env `MAGMA_PRINT_GRPC_PAYLOAD = 1`
    
    The messages that will be displayed are limited to reduce the verbosity. Pipelined messages, SPGW, AAA_server are not displayed, but they can be easilty added in case they were necessary
    
    Note we have left out `update request` comming from pipeliend since this is too verbose and only includes information that can be seen through other logs.
    
    This is an example of update request and its response

    Update reverse proxy to look at request realIP and remote addr
    
    Summary:
    In AWS, HTTP requests come in with non-localhost
    X-Forwarded-For IP at index 0. This means that realIP is never localhost.
    
    For on-prem, remoteAddr is never localhost as it gets changed to the cloud's
    host name. This means that looking at only the request's realIP or remoteAddr
    will result in an infinite loop. To solve this, we need to look at both.
    
    Since this localhost loopback proxying is temporary,
    this should be fine.

    Fixed incorrect PLMN and TAC test cases (#1917)
    
    Summary:
    ## Title
    Fixed incorrect PLMN and TAC test cases
    
    There were 2 test incorrect PLMN & TAC cases, which were not executing, although they were part of sanity suite. The reason was that it was not wrapped under any test function. Even after formatting the test cases to be executed in current test framework, the PLMN value was set as 000000 during S1-Setup request. The reason was that the value sent as array of digits was not getting parsed in string format by the S1APTester. This PR fixes these issues.

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1933
    
    Optional built into AAA Service radius server.
    As of now, only EAP (Auth) functionality is implemented. Accounting to follow.
    In order to build aaa_service with internal radius server use "with_builtin_radius" Go build tag.
    The radius server can coexist with stand alone EAP and/or accounting radius server if the do not conflict on local address:port.
    The intent of built radius server is to significantly decrease memory footprint (an additional 0.5MB of aaa_service RAM use increase and elimination of 15MB stand alone radius server RAM use)
    as well as unification of logging, simplification of management, etc.

    Convert streamer providers to be called over gRPC
    
    Summary:
    Originally, the plugin registered a set of streamer provider impls. Now, the plugin registers the same set of *remote* streamer providers, which forward to servicer providers attached to named services.
    
    This diff converts the base and lte plugins (the only plugins that expose streamers) -- adding the required LTE service (exposing the LTE stream providers) is next in the stack.
    
    The relation of streamer streams to services is n-1 -- that is, a single service can expose as many streamer streams as desired.
    
    See streamer/doc.go (below) for more info.

    Convert application Terraform to single-apply
    
    Summary:
    This diff reduces the number of required `terraform apply` calls from 5 to 3.
    
    (Actually, it also allows moving down to 2, but I think it's less error-prone to leave it at 3, treating secrets upload as a separate step.)
    
    See T69025136 for additional information.
    
    Previously, we performed the application Terraforming in three steps:
    
    - Install orc8r, without NMS
    - Create admin user in certifier, then upload those secretes to AWS Secrets Manager
    - Install orc8r, with NMS
    
    Now, instead, we generate the admin user certs ahead of time, allowing us to just
    - Install orc8r, with NMS
    - Add existing admin user in certifier

    Added traffic_cli script to send traffic to an arbitrary end point (#1886)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1886
    
    The script takes in 4 arguments in the form of `./traffic_cli.py <subcmd> <iface> <password> <endpoint>`
    The goal of this script is it will scan for available wifi networks, selects the one specified by `iface`, authenticates, then send traffic to some arbitrary end point. The only `subcmd` right now is `gen_traffic`, the script can be easily extended to support more subcommands.
    
    It should be noted that I researched different python library solutions for wifi scanning and connectivity (scapy, wifi, python-wifi) these libraries were either outdated (written in python2) and no longer supported or gave me weird errors where the fix would've been extremely hacky. I decided to proceed with subprocess calls so i could just progress through this task.

    Refactor SessionCredit to handle empty GSU case properly (#1925)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1925
    
    # A Very Long Background {emoji:1f605}
    This diff tackles the specific case where we receive a GSU with all three fields, (total, rx, tx), are marked as invalid. For more context, when SessionProxy deals with the `GrantedServiceUnit` AVP, it translates the information into this protobug message.
    ```message CreditUnit {
      bool is_valid = 1;
      uint64 volume = 2;
    }
    
    message GrantedUnits {
      CreditUnit total = 1;
      CreditUnit tx = 2;
      CreditUnit rx = 3;
    }
    ```
    For each credit type, if an AVP is specified `is_valid` is set to `true` and the `volume` is filled in. Otherwise, `is_valid` is false and `volume` is set to 0.
    The GX spec specifies in the doc below that there that there are 4 valid combinations of these grant types. (total only, rx only, tx only, and rx and tx).
    (https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/129200_129299/129212/09.03.00_60/ts_129212v090300p.pdf) PG 29
    
    The question here is what the intended behavior is for Gy. For example, if both total and rx are specified, do we just trigger on whichever threshold is met?
    My assumption in the previous refactor was that since Gx and Gy both use the same AVP for GSU, the behavior is the same. But this could be a wrong assumption, so we can fix that if it is wrong.
    
    I previously refactored `SessionCredit` to look at the GSU proto message, and infer how we should decide when the credit has exhausted its quota. D22115988 (https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/commit/76017999a1ee6b45e86015856690310b801e3943). Here's some background into why I made that change.
     ---
    ## A bit about the implementation details pre-refactor
    Before this change, when we received a volume with `is_valid=false`, we would set the volume to 0 for the following cases:
    
    - Receiving existing / Initializing Gy ChargingCredits
    - Receiving existing Gx UsageMonitors
    
    We would set the volume to max int for
    - Initializing a Gx UsageMonitor
    
    I think the original intention here was that for Gy charging grants, treat invalid GSU as just receiving 0 credit. This way, even after receiving an invalid credit, we correctly calculate its quota status as "exhausted".
    For Gx, I'm honestly not sure as to why we treat initializing and updating an existing monitor differently. One thing worth noting is that `SessionProxy` will disable any monitors with 0 GSU. So this might not matter either way. (SP code: https://www.internalfb.com/intern/diffusion/FBS/browsefile/master/fbcode/magma/feg/gateway/services/session_proxy/credit_control/gx/model_conversion.go?lines=300)
    
    But since we don't persist which values are valid or not, this poses an issue. For example, take a case where we receive Tx=400 and Rx=500 values but an invalid Total value. (And that this credit is from Gy.) With the previous implementation, we would receive the following: (total=0, tx=400, rx=500). The following is a snippet of how we calculate whether the quota has been exhausted:
    ```bool SessionCredit::is_quota_exhausted(float usage_reporting_threshold) const {
      // used quota since last report
      uint64_t total_reported_usage = buckets_[REPORTED_TX] + buckets_[REPORTED_RX];
      uint64_t total_usage_since_report = std::max(uint64_t(0), buckets_[USED_TX] + buckets_[USED_RX] - total_reported_usage);
      uint64_t tx_usage_since_report = std::max(uint64_t(0), buckets_[USED_TX] - buckets_[REPORTED_TX]);
      uint64_t rx_usage_since_report = std::max(uint64_t(0), buckets_[USED_RX] - buckets_[REPORTED_RX]);
    
      // available quota since last report
      auto total_usage_reporting_threshold = std::max(0.0f, (buckets_[ALLOWED_TOTAL] - total_reported_usage) * usage_reporting_threshold);
    
      // reported tx/rx could be greater than allowed tx/rx
      // because some OCS/PCRF might not track tx/rx,
      // and 0 is added to the allowed credit when an credit update is received
      auto tx_usage_reporting_threshold = std::max(0.0f, (buckets_[ALLOWED_TX] - buckets_[REPORTED_TX]) *  usage_reporting_threshold);
      auto rx_usage_reporting_threshold = std::max(0.0f, (buckets_[ALLOWED_RX] - buckets_[REPORTED_RX]) * usage_reporting_threshold);
    
      if (total_usage_since_report >= total_usage_reporting_threshold) {
        return true;
      } else if ((buckets_[ALLOWED_TX] > 0) && (tx_usage_since_report >= tx_usage_reporting_threshold)) {
        return true;
      } else if ((buckets_[ALLOWED_RX] > 0) && (rx_usage_since_report >= rx_usage_reporting_threshold)) {
        return true;
      }
      return false;
    }
    ```
    When we check `total_usage_since_report >= total_usage_reporting_threshold`, we incorrectly infer that quota has been exhausted here.

    # What this diff changes
    The refactor linked above had a bug where on receiving invalid GSUs the grant_tracking_type was set to `NO_TRACKING`. This was actually wrong because, we could have a case where we don't receive a valid GSU but receive a valid FinalAction. So to fix this, on receiving an invalid GSU, we should just leave the TrackingType as it is. This way, even after receiving an invalid GSU, if the quota was exhausted before, it will continue to be exhausted.
    This change means that the type `NO_TRACKING` is no longer needed, so we'll just get rid of it here.
    Additionally, now that we have a functionality to persist grant tracking type and not calculate it everytime  we receive a credit, we will initialize the tracking type to `TOTAL_ONLY` on `SessionCredit` creation.
    
    I've added unit tests on the credit level and session state level to cover these cases.

    Add change to not create a monitor when there is not monitor given
    
    Summary:
    We currently overload `UsageMonitoringUpdateResponse` with non-usage monitor related information as well.
    ```message UsageMonitoringUpdateResponse {
      UsageMonitoringCredit credit = 1;
      string session_id = 2;
      string sid = 3; // System Identification Number
      bool success = 4;
      repeated EventTrigger event_triggers = 5; <- THIS
      google.protobuf.Timestamp revalidation_time = 6; <- THIS
      uint32 result_code = 7;
      repeated string rules_to_remove = 8; <- THIS
      repeated StaticRuleInstall static_rules_to_install = 9; <- THIS
      repeated DynamicRuleInstall dynamic_rules_to_install = 10; <- THIS
      TgppContext tgpp_ctx = 11; <- THIS
    }
    ```
    This means that we could make an update exchange without any usage monitor involved. Say an update request is sent up due to a revalidation timer, then we would most likely receive a response with an empty UsageMonitoringCredit.
    
    Tldr is that we should check whether the credit field is filled in before trying to create a monitor out of it. :)

    Add multi-stream query endpoint for events
    
    Summary:
    - The existing event query endpoint is too restrictive to be useful for the NMS, we need to open up a more generic querying endpoint
    - This new endpoint allows querying for multiple streams, events, tags, and/or hwIDs as well as choosing a size and offset for paginated queries. You can also specify a start and end time for the query
    - When none of the fields are specified, this endpoint will return all events in the network up to the default result size of 50
    - Also sort the output for the old query endpoint, which we should deprecate in favor of this one

    add yarn-relay validation support (#867)
    
    Summary:
    - Added a new script to run yarn: "relay_oss", that contains the path to graphql schema when using oss-symphony - can be removed when all are moving to github.
    - Added a new job on _config.yml_ that runs `yarn relay` and && git status and verifies there's no change.

    symphony/ent-contrib: adding enum.tmpl implementing graphql encoding for ent enum field
    
    Summary:
    By default ent enum fields are treated as strings by gqlgen thus:
    - preform unnecessary escaping on encode
    - preform no validation on decode
    
    This can be avoided if the underlying type implements graphql.{Marshaler,Unmarshaler} interfaces.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/849
    
    Right now we have search functions that are not paginated
    ```
    type WorkOrderSearchResult {
      workOrders: [WorkOrder]!
      count: Int!
    }
    workOrderSearch(
        filters: [WorkOrderFilterInput!]!
        limit: Int = 500 numberValue(min: 0)
      ): WorkOrderSearchResult!
    ```
    and paginated endpoints that are not
    ```
    type WorkOrderConnection {
      edges: [WorkOrderEdge!]!
      pageInfo: PageInfo!
    }
    workOrders(
        after: Cursor
        first: Int numberValue(min: 0)
        before: Cursor
        last: Int numberValue(min: 0)
        showCompleted: Boolean
      ): WorkOrderConnection!
    ```
    
    We want to create paginated endpoints that fullfil all needs:
    ```
    type WorkOrderConnection {
      totalCount: Int!
      edges: [WorkOrderEdge!]!
      pageInfo: PageInfo!
    }
    workOrders(
        after: Cursor
        first: Int numberValue(min: 0)
        before: Cursor
        last: Int numberValue(min: 0)
        showCompleted: Boolean
        filters: [WorkOrderFilterInput!]
      ): WorkOrderConnection!
    ```
    
    New things in this endpoint:
    1. `filters` as input parameter
    2. `totalCount` as the full query count (mentioned here https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/)

    Summary:
    - mobilityd state is keyed in the format `IMSI1234567890.apn`. To reveal this state on the API attached to a subscriber entity, we will have to do a LIKE query to find all assigned IPs for a given subscriber
    - This diff adds an optional KeyPrefix field to the SearchFilter for blobstore. This new field takes precedence over the existing `Keys` filter field.

    Fixed MME crash after wait for UE cleanup timer expiry (#1882)
    
    Summary:
    ## Title
    Fixed MME crash after wait for UE cleanup timer expiry
    
    When MME was handling SCTP shutdown, wait for UE cleanup timer was started to free the eNB context. MME was crashing while handling this timer expiry because of undefined eNB reference if large number of UEs were attached. Since MME handles this cleanup after handling last UE in the eNB, hence this timer is no more needed. This PR removes the wait for UE cleanup timer.

    This allows us to configure a verbosity such as -1 to turn

    Remove CreditType from SessionCredit (#1889)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1889
    
    ## Migrate Gy Specific logic out of SessionCredit into ChargingGrant
    - `SessionCredit` currently have quite a bit of Gy specific logic. Since the class is used to track usage/quota for both Gx and Gy credits, it would simplify things to have two separate structures `Monitor` and `ChargingGrant` that use `SessionCredit` for only credit accounting.
    - `ChargingGrant` will hold final unit action info, expiry time, reauth state, and service state. These fields will be moved out of `SessionCredit` after the migration is complete.
    - It will be serialized to `StoredChargingGrant` for serialization
    
    ## What this diff changes
    - SessionCredit no longer holds any Gx/Gy specific logic so remove the CreditType. :)
    - Rearrange some function declarations in ChargingGrant.h so bunch get_* set_*, etc.

    - Set final_action / expiry time fields into ChargingGrant on receive Gy credits
    - Use the final_action/expiry time fields from ChargingGrant when retrieving the SessionCreditUpdateCriteria.
    - Add `test_charging_grant.cpp` to test `ChargingGrant` related tests
    - Make a few SessionCredit functions public to make the migration a bit easier.

       - `bool validity_timer_expired() const;`
       - `bool is_final_grant() const;`
    - Move `get_update_type()` from SessionCredit to ChargingGrant. The logic to decide whether to report for a monitor is only dependent on the quota exhaustion, but the logic for Gy is a bit more involved. This function for now uses the functions made public above^. This will be migrated to use the `ChargingGrant` fields/functions in the later diffs

    Move LTE obsidian models from plugin to respective services
    
    Summary:
    This change completes the migration of LTE plugin handlers and models
    to their respective services. This diff doesn't contain any functional changes,
    but rather put the obsidian models into the services that own these models and

    Since a few models are shared by all services, their a few models defined in one
    swagger file but used in another. This is done to avoid import cycles. While there
    may be a more natural owner for a model (e.g. subscriberdb rather than policydb),
    this was the cleanest split I saw that would actually work.

    - For displaying state, we've been relying on displaying the output of `redis-cli` for the services that save different state in redis db
    - This diff adds a debugging helper CLI to parse different magma services` state and display it in a readable manner
    - It supports parsing plain hash and set values type saved in redis
    - It also makes use of `get_json_deserializer` and `get_proto_deserializer` for state wrapped in `RedisState` protobuf

    UEsim detect server not reachable
    
    Summary:
    After checking iperf client and server, we observed that we can end up in a situation where iperf client sends traffic to the server, but the server never receives it. That leaves the client in a hang state timing out the tests and impacting following tests and, sometimes, even crashing CI test.
    
    In a previous diff we introduced a timeout parameter to set up the maximum amount of time allowed iperf client to execute before forcing a failure. That feature needed to be activated and it is time dependent.
    
    In this diff we introduced a way to detect this situation in advance. To do that we, as a iperf client, will request the server to send us a small amount of data. If we never receive that data that means the server is not reachable for some reason and we will return an error.
    
    This feature is **enabled by default**. So once landed all the test will be checking the reachability of the server in advance.
    
    The amount of bytes requested to the server is of the order of 500 (not K). So they small enough not to disrupt any traffic test (up to ~1500 in case of 3 retransmissions)
    
    **Note** that in the case of ever testing a unidirectional rule (only upload) this would trigger an error, so the feature should be disabled using the `cwfprotos.GenTrafficRequest` parameter `DisableServerReachabilityCheck`
    
    Below shows the log visible on UEsim  `Iperf server was not reachable`. We have added `Received X bytes from the server` to show the amount of bytes this feature uses (that will not be visible on the logs)

    Include EventTrigger information on CreateSessionResponse even if there are no usage monitors installed (#1894)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1894
    
    Since EventTriggers are installed on a session level, so it should be sent back similarly to how rule installs are send down. Previously, we were handling event trigger installs inside of `UsageMonitroingUsageResponse`. This doesn't work when there are no usage monitors installed. So adding the event triggers to the top level.
    
    ```message CreateSessionResponse {
      repeated CreditUpdateResponse credits = 1; // these will only have updates
      repeated UsageMonitoringUpdateResponse usage_monitors = 6;
      repeated StaticRuleInstall static_rules = 7; // static rules
      repeated DynamicRuleInstall dynamic_rules = 8; // dynamic rules
      string session_id = 9;
      TgppContext tgpp_ctx = 10;
      repeated EventTrigger event_triggers = 11; <- NEW
      google.protobuf.Timestamp revalidation_time = 12; <- NEW
    }
    ```
    
    We still need to leave the event trigger related fields inside of `UsageMonitoringUsageResponse` because of the way we send `UpdateRequest`s. For updates, we have a GRPC message per monitor/charging credit update. We should migrate the UpdateRequest request to be an array of session level updates, with monitor/charging level updates nested inside. But that change is out of scope for this diff.
    
    I've also added an additional unit test to test the case with a revalidation event trigger but no usage monitor.
    I've also modified the integ test to do the same.

    Use Redis to save pipelined enforcement state (#1773)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1773
    
    Currently we're losing a bit of stats on restart recovery as we lost the policy rule id/versio mappings on pipelined restarts. By using redis we can preserve them and recover the enforcement/enf_stats table gracefully.
    
    For unit tests stick with regular python dicts.

    Due to this change, sanity test suite had to be modified as well to remove any dependency on the hardcoded APN.

    Created stub for traffic sending script (#1866)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1866
    
    Work in progress. The end goal of this script is it will scan for available wifi networks, selects the one called "magma_wifi", authenticates, then send traffic to some arbitrary end point. For now, just creating this initial diff so future implementation won't blow up the line count.

    Add Ser/De functions for StoredChargingGrant
    
    Summary:
    ## Migrate Gy Specific logic out of SessionCredit into ChargingGrant
    - `SessionCredit` currently have quite a bit of Gy specific logic. Since the class is used to track usage/quota for both Gx and Gy credits, it would simplify things to have two separate structures `Monitor` and `ChargingGrant` that use `SessionCredit` for only credit accounting.
    - `ChargingGrant` will hold final unit action info, expiry time, reauth state, and service state. These fields will be moved out of `SessionCredit` after the migration is complete.
    - It will be serialized to `StoredChargingGrant` for serialization
    
    ## What this diff changes
    - Add `serialize_stored_charging_grant` and `deserialize_stored_charging_grant` to for serializing into Redis DB
      - These internally uses the serializing functions for SessionCredit
    - Add unit tests for the functions above^
    
    ## Note
    At this point none of the fields other than the `SessionCredit` field in `ChargingGrant` is used. The following diffs will migrating each field at a time.

    Fix bug in state sync on SessionD restart
    
    Summary:
    We were observing on GWs with stateless sessiond that on restart, we always see `Failed to mark a scheduled dynamic rule as installed with rule_id: whitelist_sid-IMSI460660003600005`
    
    This was occurring because traversal of `scheduled_dynamic_rules` and `dynamic_rules` were using the same variable. So first, we append dynamic_rules ids into the `rule_ids` vector. We do some logic based on that vector and then we append on scheduled dynamic rule ids onto the same vector.
    This meant that the logic meant for scheduled dynamic rules was being applied to both scheduled and not scheduled dynamic rules

    Use NULL to indicate output rule param is not needed (#1864)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1864
    
    - In `PolicyRuleBiMap`, `get_rule` and `remove_rule` has an optional rule_out parameter to copy the rule into the variable.
    - We have several instances where we pass a throwaway variable when we don't need the rule definition. This can be confusing when reading the code, so this diff replaces all of those to NULL.

    Convert metrics exporters to be called over gRPC
    
    Summary:
    As part of the transition to the orc8r service mesh, the `GetMetricsProfiles` plugin method (custom collectors and exporters) is being replaced with custom exporters accessible over RPC.
    
    ## Architecture changes
    
    Custom collectors are being replaced in favor of opinionated metric collection.
    
    Custom exporters are made available by services implementing the `MetricsExporter` servicer, where we'll use service labels (k8s for prod and docker-compose for dev) to provide service discovery.
    
    In the interim, before service discovery is enabled, we retain the `MetricsProfile` concept in the plugin iface, where the registered exporters are now of type `remoteExporter`, which forward requests over RPC to the relevant service.
    
    ## Existing exporters
    
    We have two existing exporters -- one pushing to Prometheus pushgateways, and one pushing to ODS. For the former (the standard exporter), we use it as the metricsd exporter. For the latter (FB-internal), we create the `fbinternal` service (as a precursor to the `fbinternal` service replacing the FB-internal plugin) as an attach point for the ODS exporter.

    Add storybook MDX support + first MDX story
    
    Summary:
    This diff adds the ability to have a docs section for your components, group together different use cases with each having a separate iframe and write description for them with mdx.
    it will make using the DS easier for people who are unfamiliar with it.
    It's similar to FB's UI docs.
    
     ---
    
    I looked at several options for better documenting our DS components.
    1. Wix - https://wix-style-react.now.sh/?path=/story/*
    2. Shopify Polaris - https://polaris.shopify.com/components/get-started
    
    Both use storybook but implement docs in different ways.
    1. Wix implemented their own suite of components for documentation - including a playground, code previews etc. A lot of code and effort went into this.
    2. Shopify wrote their own MD parser which is very fragile and riddled with bad practices: https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react/blob/master/.storybook/polaris-readme-loader.js
    
     ---
    
    Storybook added official support for MDX files with an addon: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/docs
    
    After a lot of setup, writing the actual MDX story was easy and it looks nice and supports code snippets.

    Magma LTE Dashboard Stylized (#1774)
    
    Summary:
    ## Overview
    Completed Styling various core elements of the Magma LTE Dashboard and began creating local magmalte global styles based off of the Brave UX Figma designs.
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8878152/84198079-029b9b00-aa71-11ea-9629-c599bdd4e944.png)
    
     ---
    
    ### Local Theming
    Within `magmalte/app` is now a `theme` directory intended to better unify the front-end design system to that found within the design files.
    
    At the moment the `default.js` file exports 3 core design types, though more will probably follow in the future as they are needed:
    
    #### Colors
    Colors are broken into subgroups (primary, secondary, state, data, and code), and then defined based off of the hex color code. For the most part they should match closely with those found in the design file.
    
    In the case you need to add a color, I used [this site](http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/) to generate names based off of the color hex. Many text editors will also have plugins that leverage this naming convention, but I don't foresee needing to add all that many more colors.
    
    #### Typography
    Nothing crazy here other than. I adapted the Symphony styles to better match our styles defined in the design file. In addition I brought over the `Text.js` file that was being used from `fbcnms/ui/components/design-system/Text` into our local theme directory as well (`magmalte/app/theme/design-system/Text`).
    
    I've removed a fair amount of the code, such as color, since the overhead on maintaining such a system isn't great. I recommend using local `classNames` to handle modifying the color.
    
    #### Shadows
    Similar to typography, not a whole lot of notable stuff here other than I only brought over a few of the DPI's I know are used. I may have missed some, so we may need to adapt this further in the future, but it's a good starting point.

    Since there still currently are users with 'Owner' role, when users data for user management ui, I am changing all 'Owner' role users to 'Admin'.
    Once data will be fully migrated, all reference to 'Owner' will be able to be removed from UI.
    
    As for permissions enforcement, ui enforcement needs no change as it is not checking the user's role in any stage (only it's privileges).

    - SessionCredit has a private field named 'unlimited_quota`, this value is derived from the CreditUpdateResponse protobuf message. Instead of translating this value into a boolean to indicate whether the credit is INFINITE or not, just use the enum
    - The enum is a ternary value, so it doesn't really make sense to trasnlate it into a bool value

    - Modified serialize/deserialize logic to reflect the change in type

    Refactor SessionCredit's grant tracking logic
    
    Summary:
    ## Grant Tracking Type
    - There are a few ways that the PCRF/OCS can specify how usage should be tracked: TOTAL_ONLY, RX_ONLY, TX_ONLY, RX_AND_TX
       - https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/129200_129299/129212/09.03.00_60/ts_129212v090300p.pdf
       - ^ See Page 29
       - Essentially, if a credit is given for only RX, then we should only trigger an update when the RX usage has exceeded the threshold.
    - Previously, the way we handled this was to make "invalid" values as int max or 0. (Some computation logic made it work so that it didn't trigger an update). But this was pretty hard to keep track of, so I decided to just explicitly set a type depending on the GSU received.
    - Logically, this doesn't really affect the two cases used the most: RX_AND_TX and TOTAL_ONLY. But for RX_ONLY and TX_ONLY, I think the expected behavior is that we only send AVPs for those two fields. But this I will have to check with others.
    
    ## Usage Report Limit
    - I got rid of the variable `usage_reporting_limit`, since it's not really something that has to be persisted. The reasoning here is that we never want to report more than we've been given a grant for. We can compute this every time we calculate how much usage to report.
    
    ## Other Stuff
    - `is_quota_exhausted` is now a public function. It's only used in testing for now but this is intentional. Eventually, we should directly call this in SessionState

    Add timoeout option for iperf genTraffic on the uesim
    
    Summary:
    On cwag integ_test restart  tests, uesim gen traffic (that uses iperf client) may end up in a hang situation (ie when traffic is generated too early before restart is completed)
    
    To avoid the test to hang hang indefinitely, we added a new parameter (timeout) to the uesim (configurable through `GenTrafficRequest` protos.
    
    That timeout will stop the client and return error, but we will still receive a meaningful message that will allow us to debug if traffic was flowing.
    
    Note this is not a way to execute iperf for N seconds. The client has an specific parameter to set the length of the test. `timeout` it is a max value we will wait until returning error.
    
    Example:
    
    ```
            req := &cwfprotos.GenTrafficRequest{
                    Imsi:        imsi,
                    ReverseMode: true,
                    Volume:      &wrappers.StringValue{Value: *swag.String("5M")},
                    Timeout:     60,
            }
    ```
    
    example of error returned

    Add more functionality to Gateway Logs
    
    Summary:
    - Added a new export button and overrode the default export mechanism in Material Table. The default behavior would only export 5 records(page size) worth of information. New export button would export 10000 lines.
    - Additionally changed the current log fetching mechanism to also be filtered by the date time picker used in filtering histograms
    - Also added a total log count top of the histogram
    Still TBD
    - Need to add filtering capability based on specific fields
    - Need to add sorting capability from the orc8r

    move pipeline ip mac flow install and IPFIX update from sessiond into AAA server (#1814)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1814
    
    This diff includes:
    
    - Move ip mac flow install from Sessiond to AAA server
    - Move IPFIix update from Sessiond to AAA server
    - Added test services and test cases to AAA Server
    
    The idea is to remove from sessiond the logic of installing the flows when a new session or when recycle a session. On AAA server this is going to be detected using the stored context. If a session with that imsi already exists, and that context contains a core session id, that means the user already had a session on the system, so we just need to update the IPFIX flows. Otherwise, we will install the mac flows from scratch
    
    Since accounting.go has more logic now, we have also added new test services to aaa server to be able to test the code

    - In order to properly replicate states from AGW redis to Orchestrator, MME needs to write its states using the RedisState wrapper message
    - Instead of updating all the MME application code to track state versions, this diff modifies the redis client to read a key for its current version before writing it with an incremented version
    - The redis client will also unwrap the inner state from the wrapper message when reading from Redis

    Add reverse proxy middleware to obsidian server (#1838)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1838
    
    This diff introduces a reverse proxy middleware
    to the Orchestrator's obsidian server. For now this middleware
    re-route non-localhost addr request back to the obsidian server,
    changing the remote addr to localhost.
    
    Eventually this middleware will be used to properly proxy
    requests to the appropriate echo server (e.g. cwf obsidian server
    for /cwf/networks/...)

    Insert redirection rules to gy_dynamic_rules_to_install list only (#1834)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1834
    
    Currently, the redirect rule is inserted both lists : gy_dynamic_rules_to_install and dynamic_rules_to_install.
    
    After rule deactivation, only gy_dynamic_rule is updated and thus redirect rule in dynamic_rule will trigger new
    requests to pipelined to activate it again.
    
    ```

    Fix mem leak in GRPCReceiver (#1833)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1833
    
    Under heavy load, Sessiond crashes multiple times during memory allocation.
    
    ```

    ```
    
    Crash address hints that the issue is related to aync calls to pipelined/directoryd/AAAclient.
    
    Looking at the code of GRPCReceiver.h, it seems that we could hit a memory corruption if the AsyncLocalResponse object is deleted in handle_response before
    moving the reader to the response_reader_ attribute.
    
    ```
    78  void set_response_reader(
    79      std::unique_ptr<grpc::ClientAsyncResponseReader<ResponseType>> reader) {
    80    reader->Finish(&response, &status, this);
    81    response_reader_ = std::move(reader);
    82  }
    ...
    121  void handle_response() {
    122    this->callback(this->status, this->response);
    123    delete this;
    124  }
    ```
    
    This can be confirmed by printing the address of this and this->response_reader_ just before the delete. the latest would be NULL just before the sigfault.
    In addition, the destructor is set to virtual as the class has a virtual method to force calling the correct destructor for sub-classes.

    Make RestartHandler more thread-safe (#1826)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1826
    
    ## Issue
    - See here for paste of ASAN output: P133390744
      - `for (const auto& iter : sessions_to_terminate_) {` on line 72 was accessing a freed address
      - `sessions_to_terminate_.erase(sid);` on line 133 frees the address in a created thread
    - This probably happens, when one of the thread spawned reaches the second line, when the original thread is still accessing/modifying the map
    
    ## Solution
    - Introduced a mutex to guard reads/writes/deletes for the sessions_to_terminate map
    
    ## Other Cosmetic Changes
    - Created `populate_sessions_to_terminate_with_retries` to consolidate logic that fetches session IDs from DirectoryD
    - Created `launch_threads_to_terminate_with_retries` to consolidate logic that launches threads to send Terminate requests up to the FeG/PolicyDB.
    - Some comments
    
    ## Notes for future
    - Should we just be batching these terminate requests?

    * Execute workflow with this task type
    * Observe `wasm-worker` logs, it is expected that following lines will appear immediately:
    ```
    GLOBAL___js {
      args: 'q',
      outputIsJson: 'true',
      script: "console.log(JSON.stringify({name: process.argv[1]})); console.error('logging');"

    Breaking UserManagementContext into lazy loaded queries - Policies
    
    Summary:
    No change in logic.
    
    Just in data flow architecture.
    Instead of having a centralized user management context holding fetching all data in once and serving all related views, each 'area' (users \ groups \ policies) manages its own data (using a new designated hooks \ util functions).
    
    The initial idea (with the centralized context) was to reduce server roundtrips and have all logic at one place.
    It did result with good performance (no data fetching while navigating in user management views).
    Yet, once needed to have bi-directional references between all types of elements (user-group-policies) the price of maintaining those links (on each and every mutation) changed the tradeoff balance towards this change.
    
    This particular diff handles the Policies area.
    The following two diffs handle Groups and Users.
    I've tried as possible to separate the changes, but obviously, there are some side effects due to the nature of the dependencies the different parts share.

    port. Following patch fixes it.
    This would be useful for Non-nat config.

    Move activity log to async service and control move with feature flag (#749)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/749
    
    First, open `work_order_activities_hook` completely. It was already opened for partners with no issues.
    Second, create a new feature flag `move_work_order_activities_to_async_service` to determine if it the events should be handled inside the hook as it is now or inside the async service.
    Also remove `graph_event_logging` and just use `move_work_order_activities_to_async_service`. If it's on just send the event and the async service will just handle it if it's a work order event.
    
    Temporal changes for "Experiement" phase:
    * I moved `graph/event/workorder_activities.go` to `graph/event/workorder_activities.go` because I need it both from `graph` and from `async`. Once I open the feature flag, I'll move it to `async` only
    * I left `graph/event/workorder_activities_test.go` and copied it to `async/handler/workorder_activities_test.go`. Once I open the feature flag I'll delete `graph/event/workorder_activities_test.go`

    Unroll MonitorMap from CreditPool into SessionState (#1791)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1791
    
    Apologies in advance, this diff is messy...
    
    ## Motivation
    - Currently, the control logic is split into two components in SessionD. SessionState, and SessionCredit.
    - We had a service in the middle to manage the gx/gy monitor/credits between the two services above. This meant that there is a lot of logic to move actions back and forth between the two levels.
    - This stack of diffs gets rid of the CreditPool class and embeds the gx/gy monitor/credit maps into SessionState.
    - Once this is done, I will work on reducing control logic from SessionCredit and move it to SessionState.
    
    ## Change Summary
    - SessionState now holds a map of MonitoringKey -> Monitor instead of the monitor pool object
    - SessionStore is also modified to reflect this change
    - Some minor function renames to indicate that it's for monitors
    - Some minor refactors to move down private methods into the private field, add const to functions that don't modify the internal state
    
    - I've also moved ChargingCredit related functions into one section of the file. Same thing with Monitor related functions

    Once deployed I will have several instances of async service and I want to make sure each event is consumed by exactly one service.
    At the end for doing it, all that is needed is: `nats://graph.event` -> `nats://graph.event?queue=asyncz`
    * since urls are now different between publisher and subscriber (one with queue group and one without also support this case)
    
    **parallel execution**
    Until now, each async service handled one event at a time. However, this is not enough even for amount of ent operations we could have.
    With this diff, the main go routine only reads events, parses them and create go routine for further work
    I use `waitGroup` to track amount of running go routines
    **Graceful shutdown**
    In order to close the service instance without interrupting operations in the middle refactored the main so that:
    1. At first we subscribe to the pubsub and span go routines
    2. After the signal I wait for go routines to finish and call `pubsub.Shutdown` that sends acks that were not sent yet

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/738
    
    Since I am refactoring the way we publish\subscribe events, I added integration test to graphql subscriptions to make sure I don't break it.
    Now tests run both inventory tests and workforce tests.

    Clean up memory leak from SessionState (#1818)

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1818
    
    Running valgrind on sessiond and running `make integ_test TESTS=s1aptests/test_attach_detach_multi_ue.py`

    Solve race condition for memory allocation from the itti memory pool to the itti messages (#1805)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1805
    
    ITTI library utilizes a preallocated memory pool to be used for ITTI messages. As all the threads are using the same memory pool, race conditions should be handled via atomic function calls. In acquiring an index from the memory pool, the steps were not atomic, leading to the potential allocation of the same index to more than one ITTI message. This was causing issues at the time of freeing itti messages caught by assert statements. In PR#1015 in github repo, Pavel provided a solution for this which was potentially creating an infinite loop. As original PR was never modified based on the reviews, this diff is created to address this specific issue.

    Fix qos state upon restart (#1811)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1811
    
    Fix a bug in non clean restart logic.
    Recently(D21975684) subscriber_map[imsi][rule_num] was changed to store list of tuples rather than tuple. This wasn't reflected in the restart logic. This causes exception in pipelined upon restart. This fix addresses this issue. Enhanced the unit test to also verify this case.
    Additionally added a pipelined dumper function and enhanced existing container utilities to run arbitrary set of commands and get outputs. Currently i'm using this for dumping pipelined state.We could use it in additional test verification as well.

    Add pagination and custom search support to Log Table
    
    Summary:
    Used a custom remote data function to ensure that we can paginate.
    The remote data function query also contains the search terms which we can use to filter the results with.
    
    Note that we currently don't have support to sort the results yet. We have to add backend support for sorting the results.
    Additionally elastic search 'from' clause only supports size upto 10,000, beyond that we have to use search_after clause and we need to add backend support for that as well.
    
    Finally the export mechanism currently exports a page size worth of information which isn't very useful. Will make additional changes in upcoming reviews to ensure that we can save the query and export the entire state.

    Transition to over-the-wire indexing
    
    Summary:
    ### Eventual goal
    Once the plugin is fully replaced by the service mesh architecture...
    
    State service
    - receives a list of services with an indexer from k8s
    - makes an `Indexer.GetInfo` call to the service to cache indexer id, version, and types -- then inserts indexer into the remote registry
    - proceeds as before -- the fact that prepare/index/complete calls go over the wire is implicit
    
    Indexing service (a service that wants to perform state indexing)
    - define and register its indexing servicer
    
    ### Before
    Originally, state indexers are registered via plugin. The operated locally, and there were any number of logical indexers. Each indexer was logically "owned" by a particular service, but ultimately the state service handled everything locally.
    
    The main change here is the service-indexer relation was originally 1-n, but is now 1-1. Individual services can choose how to best manage performing multiple logical extractions per `Index` call.
    
    ### Now / transition phase
    Since we're still using the plugin architecture in the interim:
    - no k8s -- remote indexers are registered directly during plugin registration, using hard-coded values
    - remote indexer registry accepts `Indexer` iface rather than just `RemoteIndexer` -- makes testing easier for now
    
    ### Other changes
    - s/subscriptions/stateTypes/g -- subscriptions were stateType+matcher, where matcher is a closure. Since arbitrary closures can't be sent over the network, it's simpler to just pre-filter by state types
    - parallelize `Index` calls during `ReportStates` -- before, each indexer was called sequentially; with requests now going over the network (and taking potentially arbitrary duration), we use a tunable number of worker goroutines to send then report the Index calls

    Add remote indexing service definition
    
    Summary:
    Each service which desires to perform indexing implements the `Indexer` servicer. This is similar to how local indexing worked, except (a) only one logical indexer per service and (b) indexing occurs over the wire.
    
    Also, to delineate the purpose of the cli-based indexer servicer, we rename that servicer to `IndexerManager`.

    - added return type for getHttpLogger since it was missing and assumed any
    
    I'd love to hear thoughts on `es6` import vs `require` imports, and if we should update our codebase. There's quite a few calls that do `const logger = require('fbcnms/logging').getLogger(module);` in es6 import code.

    MME crash fix due to not sufficient queue sizes and not handling packets that could not be enqueued. (#1772)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1772
    
    When sctp shutdown happens, it triggers a message flooding on itti queues for main MME tasks. This results with some messages not being enqueued successfully yet the file descriptor is written to signal that a message is enqueued for the receiver end. Now, such messages are dropped and memory for them are deallocated. Error log is entered.
    
    Additionally, the queue sizes for critical apps are increased to 2048 that should be able to handle simultaneous detach for at least that many UEs. Thus, packet drop events should be even more rare in production.
    
    Unused task queue definitions are also removed completely for better engineering.

    Qos refactoring bugfix
    
    Summary:
    When testing this on MCP, discovered that i had bug where i had made an assumption that a rule_num was associated with either UPLINK or DOWNLINK Qos. The bug can cause leak of ovs meters during cleanup. The fix sets the [imsi][rule_num] dict value to a list of tuples containing (qos_handle, direction) instead of being assigned it to a single tuple.
    
    Also normalized IMSI prior to addition or deletion of QOS

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1786
    
    ### Changes
    - `SessionStore` has a new method called `sync_request_numbers`, which is intended to be called before a caller reports usage updates.
    - New unit test in `test_session_store.cpp`, `test_sync_request_numbers`
    - `SessionStore` will no longer have the request_number of each session incremented during read. Instead, readers are responsible for syncing in incremented request_numbers to SessionStore before yielding control back to the event loop
    - Deleted `SessionStore`'s `read_sessions_for_reporting`

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1771
    
    For the standalone UI we need a way to know what tenants exist in the system. In the NMS, this source of truth exists outside of configmanager. However when it's run as a standalone system, the only source for this information is the alertmanager configurer itself.
    
    Adding this allows the UI to be populated with a list of tenants to select from

    The bar chart is currently using mocked data. I'm working on making changes to orc8r to include Elastic search's count api. Once we have this api we should be able to use that and get the log counts for the desired time period.

    Fix to get memory leak summary after code coverage during CI (#1755)
    
    Summary:
    ### Title
    Fix to get memory leak summary after code coverage during CI
    
    The current target coverage_oai in Makefile does not terminate the magma services gracefully. Hence, the memory leak summary is not dumped in syslog  during CI run and some of the cleanup function calls are not included in overall coverage report. This PR fixes the issue by adding a separate target coverage_oai_terminate for terminating the Magma services gracefully before generating the coverage info.

    Fix Revalidation Timer
    
    Summary:
    - When a Revalidation Timer is installed for a session, we set a timer. This diff introduces the change to mark the session state to indicate that an event trigger was added. `schedule_revalidation`
    - When the timer expires, we mark the revalidation timer field in the even triggers map to indicate that an update should be sent for the trigger. See call back in `schedule_revalidation`
    - Next timer we are collecting updates, we will check the session's event trigger map to see if any event triggers are ready to be acted on. If it is, we will send an update request with NO USAGE MONITOR and the event trigger field set. `get_updates_from_monitor_pool` (We currently only support revalidation timer)
    
    Also included in this diff is serialization/deserialization methods for the newly introduced event trigger map.
    And also modified unit tests to reflect the new behavior

    Add EventTrigger to indicate the reason for the Update Request
    
    Summary:
    Some background here:
    When a session is initialized through Gx, the PCRF can install various event triggers to trigger an update request from PCEF->PCRF. The most common way is `USAGE_REPORT`, where some number of bytes is given for the session, and when the credit is used up, the PCEF is required to report back to PCRF.
    However, there can be other event triggers as well, like Revalidation Timer. This is a timer set by the PCRF to trigger an update request in a set amount of time.
    Each update request has to indicate what the trigger was for the request.
    
    This diff adds an additional EventTrigger field to `UsageMonitoringUpdateRequest`
    Right now, all Gx Update Requests are hardcoded to have the EventTrigger reason `USAGE_REPORT`
    For other event triggers like revalidation timer, we do not want to send a usage report and the event trigger AVP needs to indicate that it was triggered by the revalidation timer.

    Upgrade all xenial docker images to bionic (#1778)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1778
    
    Currently magmad runs using bionic, but other gateway and
    orchestrator containers run using xenial. This diff updates all docker
    images to use bionic as their base OS.
    
    This removes xenial from running in any part of magma. End of support
    for Xenial is in April of 2021, so now seems like an appropriate time
    to upgrade these components.

    Pull out coredumps from SessionD container
    
    Summary:
    ## IntegTest change
    - SessionD has been periodically crashing on the integration test setup, so this should help with the debugging
    - Coredumps are redirected to the CWAG VM's /var/opt/magma/cores
    - The current behavior is that it clears that directory on every new run
    - `transfer_service_logs` -> `transfer_artifacts`
      - Now makes a tar of all coredumps in /var/opt/magma/cores and puts into magma/cwf/gateway/integ_tests
    
    ## CI change
    - run `fab transfer_artifacts:services={services},get_core_dump=True`
    - transfer tar file to /tmp/logs

    Rbac workflows proxy (#1709)
    
    Summary:
    **Summary:**
    
    Create a second level proxy in workflows/ which performs additional filtering based on User's groups.
    In general it only shows workflow definitions which belong to user's groups and only shows executions which were triggered by current user.
    
    UI that talks to this proxy is called Service porta and is constructed from the same set of components that build workflow UI (but they are further limited).
    
    **TODOs**
    - In the workflows/rbac proxy, additional checks need to be introduced in order to prevent users accessing workflow resources from outside their groups
    - routes.js should not mix scheduling with the core workflow REST API, refactor the /metadata/workflow endpoint
    - Add user group caching (per session) so that groups do not have to be looked up for every single request
    
    **Notes**
    - The commit is bigger since there was some refactoring required e.g. routes.js -> move all the code into a function for re-usability or WorkflowDefs -> refactor render into smaller components for re-usability
    - User group management does not have a UI and graphQL needs to be used directly
    
    **Test plan**
    - As fbuser@fb.com create 2 arbitrary workflows. Mark one of them with "OPERATOR" label.
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3070975/82577606-84438b80-9b8b-11ea-8594-e0e70d1fae0b.png)
    - You should see following workflow definitions
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3070975/82577729-ad641c00-9b8b-11ea-9a51-f381db513bdb.png)
    - Go into master UI and add second user (fbuser2@fb.com) to fb-test organization
    - Via graphQL, create group "operator" and assign user fbuser2@fb.com to it
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3070975/82577891-ec926d00-9b8b-11ea-81b1-685378f6e1a4.png)
    `mutation addUserGroupOperator {
      addUsersGroup(input: { name: "operator" }) {
        id
        name
        status
        members {
          authID
        }
      }
    }
    mutation editUsersGroupAddUser2ToOpers {
      editUsersGroup(
        input: { id: 171798691841, description: "test", members: [167503724545] }
      ) {
        id
        members {
          id
          email
        }
      }
    }`
    - Now logout as fbuser@fb.com and login as fbuser2@fb.com and in the workflow view you should see limited UI (service portal) with only 1 of the workflows accessible

    Fix ephemeral final action unit and info (#1748)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1748
    
    ```is_final_grant``` was not being updated on ```update_criteria``` object when received from ```UpdateRequest```.
    
    ```final_action_info``` did not exists on ```SessionCreditUpdateCriteria``` struct, so it was never recorded
    
    Both issues caused that after final grant was received, those attributes were not saved on the object. So next time the session was used, those settings were back to their default value. Session was never terminated by final action unit, but for quota exhaustion. When ```EXTRA_QUOTA_MARGIN``` was removed, this issue was uncovered.
    
    This diff adds also a log line that can be use in the future to see the value of the final unit and the value of redirect server
    
    This diff also includes a small change to help to configure cwag integ_test properly to run integ test manually from ```cwag_test```.

    Remove EXTRA_QUOTA_MARGIN (#1712)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1712
    
    Extra quota was added in the past to terminate the session after quota was exhausted + safety margin. The intention of this was to terminate the session if we lose connectivity with the core. The extra_quota_margin, gave provide some margin to avoid terminations due to spurial disconnections.
    
    That feature caused side effects, plus we shouldn't be checking network issues inferring them through quota. Also note sessiond should be executing the termination, but not deciding if the the session needs to be terminated. That should be decided by core
    
    The new behaviour is: if we go over quota, but not final unit is received, sessiond will just record the usage but not terminate.  With that we make sure sessiond do not decide over the session, and we have a simpler algorithm

    Allow event hook to work independent of permissions (#707)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/707
    
    For querying information about the Ent event we need to query information about the all ent fields and edges.
    This sometimes would not be possible because of user permissions.
    However since in this case this information is returned back to the user, attach Decision context to `Allow` to allow this operation

    Fix version reporting for magamd docker gateways (#1763)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1763
    
    Previously, version reporting did not work for when magmad was set to run on docker. The version would always report '0.0.0' instead of the docker image tag.
    The fix was to check if the service's config init_system field is set to docker, then parse out the image tag and set the version to it.

    Serialize/deserialize session fsm state (#1761)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1761
    
    The state was not being properly stored on stateless mode.
    `TestGxUsageReportEnforcement` was not passing on stateless. This was because the termination will only complete if the session state is in a terminating state. Since the fsm_state was not set, the default value is ACTIVE -> no termination ever succeeds
    
    modified unit test to assert serialization/deserialization happens for fsm_state
    
    Note: I will enable statelss flag on cwf integ test to prevent these regressions in the future. (There's another bug being fixed so will wait for that)D21857619

    Deserialization of stored charging credit pool is faulty (#1762)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1762
    
    In stateless mode, we don't serialize all the fields of CreditKey (rating group, service identifier but not use_sid).
    During deserialization, we reconstruct the key using the constructor CreditKey(uint32_t rg, uint32_t si) which set use_sid to true in all the cases.
    Except that service identifier is very often set to 0 => use_sid should be False.
    Lookup in credit_map is then failing.

    Remove activity privacy rules until moving the making of it to another service (#703)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/703
    
    Right now accessing\writing the activity log happen in a hook in the same context of the user that performed the operation.
    It leads to case where the user change the owner of the work order to other person and now he can't see the work order anymore but we still expect him to be able to able to write to this work order activity log.
    
    We already have a new process async that will run with an automation context. This service will receive the events and write to the activity log and will not have permissions issues. once this will happen I will return the privacy rules.
    T67933416 to track it.
    Current status of async service: already running locally, next step to deploy in production.

    Hence, the main essence of the fix is about normalizing to a filtered (filtering out deleted property types) sorted (by the index attribute) array.

    Small cleanup for the configmanager. The <tenantID>_tenant_base_route receiver exists for technical reasons to allow independent routing across tenants. The user will never interact with this receiver directly, so it's confusing when it shows up in the UI under the list of receivers.

    `ent.Node` was chosen because he stores the entire ent state in a serialisable way.
    `event.LogEntry` is already used by `activity log` and will be used by `audit log` and `rules engine`
    We found two issues that make using `ent.Node` inconvenient:
    1. Field name and edge name are stored in Pascal and not in their column names in database. This makes checks like `field.Name==todo.FieldText` impossible. The fix here is to store the regular names and in the UI change then with `pascalCase` for more convenient view
    2. Values are stored in their json representation. Instead that each application will need to run `json.Unmarshal` on them first, I added helper functions in `node.go`

    symphony/store: set content-type on signed put requests
    
    Summary:
    Following D21818345 store uses go-cloud blob package to sign urls however in old implementation we simply ignored `contentType` query param send by clients nor did we set it when singing s3 PUT requests.
    
    In new implementation the above translates to us signing the PUT requests expecting an `empty` content type which s3 will reject with 403 error as the actual PUT request will set `Content-Type` to the same value passing in sign request.
    
    To address the issue we simple pass `ContentType` to PUT requests received from clients.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/696
    
    * Makes chunks handle a bit better (meaning that async resources will be fetched on demand)
    * Also adding async loading of the site sections, so those are chunked separately properly (as the payload is fairly big).  This results in saved initial payload of ~7mb uncompressed
      * This means that, e.g., all hub dependencies (semantic-ui, etc) are all loaded on demand
    * Also, changing source-map to `eval-cheap-source-map` changed incremental builds from 10s to 2.5s

    Fixing enodeb status mismatch while reporting metrics (#1727)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1727
    
    - When disconnecting, there's cases when the status and stats metrics aren't cleared properly due to the `rf_tx_on` setting not updated properly, which caused an issue of some enodeb reported metrics getting into  a stuck state
    - This diffs add `enodeb_connected` check on enodeb status to update and clear metrics in case the enodeb is disconnected
    - Updates `test_check_rf_tx` as stats will be cleared once the enodeb is disconnected and RF tx on is false.

    this should not be persisted to data store. Traffic tests were failing before
    this change as the SPGW task was trying to read the value from data store at
    init and overwriting the value from config with 0.0.0.0.

    In this Diff we refactor the secret subchart to follow best practice like
    
    1. load certs from ourside helm chart directory
    
       ```bash
            example: helm install --name cwf01 --namespace magma -f global-vals.yaml \
                     --set-file secrets.gwinfo.snowflake=/path/to/file/snowflake
    
       ```
    
    2. having option to load secrets or files from override values.
    
       ```bash
            secret:
              enabled: false
                # variable holding gateway's hwid (snowflake) and challenge key
              gwinfo:
                snowflake: |-
                  f3bc383a95db16f2e448fdf67cac133a5f9019375720b59477
       ```
    3. encrypting vals file with secrets if needed.

    This diff turns off tls for the td-agent-bit service if gateway certs don't exist.
    This ensures that the service doesn't enter a restart loop (causing integ tests to fail).
    After a successful bootstrap the service is restarted and tls will be enabled.

    Fix standby session timeout bug for CWAG HA (#1736)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1736
    
    When we failover gateways, the existing sessions
    should be transferred to the new active. Since the AAA server
    sessions on the standby aren't clear, eventually these sessions
    timeout and terminate the sessiond session. Since sessiond sessions
    are shared via Redis, this ultimately causes a termination of an
    active session on the active gateway.
    
    This diff fixes this behavior by restarting the AAA server on the Disable
    RPC call. Restarting the AAA server will clear standby sessions will ensuring
    the service is still in an idle state.

    Summary:
    Since Maria doesn't support the non-standard `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` suffix needed for the reindex job queue, we need to provide a mechanism for manually triggering reindexes for deployments using Maria.
    
    This CLI is run from a controller container, and can be found at `/var/opt/magma/bin`
    
    Some commands:
    - `./indexer list -s -n` list all indexer names (`-s` silences log output while registering plugins)
    - `./indexer list` list all indexers, with actual+desired versions
    - `./indexer reindex` perform all necessary reindex jobs

    Prepare reindexer for usage in indexer servicer
    
    Summary:
    The overarching need is for a `reindex.RunUnsafe`, to be called from the indexer servicer.
    
    Some simplifications that arose from this reorganization:
    - Attach `reindex.Run` and `reindex.RunUnsafe` to a `Reindexer` interface, along with the `GetVersions` method, to greatly simplify testing the indexer servicer (and avoid redundant testing)
    - Clean up the redundancy between `GetAllErrors` and `GetAllJobInfo`
    - Indexer versions are now read+updated dynamically (on every call, rather than only at queue init time--to support testing and later service mesh changes)
    - Move "state internal store" (for `GetAllIDs`) to a more reasonable+flexible home as a standalone object+interface as `reindex.Store`
    - Move indexer subscription filtering to the subscription object (consolidation for easier testing)
    - Clean up test_service_init a bit

    Test Session IDLE timer feature (#1728)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1728
    
    There's a gateway configuration for the AAA service that kicks off a session that has been idle for >configured amount of time.
    
    Since the default value for idle timer is big, I'm swapping in a smaller value for this test by overwriting the default mconfig. (The value is big by default because we don't want this feature interfering with the other tests)
    
    Also some light refactor to the fabfile to use helper functions `_switch_to_vm` & `_switch_to_vm_no_destroy`

    Summary:
    - Some of the tests we have need custom gateway mconfigs that should not apply to all the other tests.
    - We currently handle this by modifying the config from the fabfile and running tagged tests separately.
    - Since karthiksubraveti introduced a way to talk to docker containers from inside the test, utilizing that here to add a functionality to modify the gateway mconfig

    Fixing misc issues caused due to Qos refactoring
    
    Summary:
    Recent Qos changes caused two issues during setup
    
    1. Qos configs created in linux tc was not using hexadecimal numbers(most likely an issue in previous implementation as well). We see it now since during clean restart we aggressively delete all existing Qos state.
    2. redis connection failure wasn't being handled. Added a timer handler and a callback to ensure that we keep retrying redis connection every second and when it succeeds we trigger the setup process. This is important during recovery.

    Make Wallet Exhaust Behavior Configurable from Orc8r (#1717)
    
    Summary:

    We have a feature currently in SessionD, that terminates sessions when the subscriber's wallet is empty in CWF.
    This behavior is hardcoded as a CWF only feature, and the way we detect the wallet exhaustion is also hardcoded in SessionD. (The way we support is to see how many Gx tracked rules are active)
    
    This was fast hack to implement this feature back in Jan. For upcoming trials, we will want to support other methods of detecting wallet exhaustion. Eventually, this configuration should be exposed to the orc8r API.
    For now, I'll make this behavior configurable through the Mconfig.
    FWA gateways will have this feature turned off, and CWF gateways will have it turned on with the Gx Rules detection method.

    Summary:
    - Basically copied all the existing proxy services and deployment including the values.yml block. If this soaks well in staging/prod for the next 2-4 weeks then I'll delete the old proxy stuff
    - Really the only big change is that the `api.` subdomain will now resolve to the main proxy service instead of clientcert due to how we have to configure nginx

    Summary:
    Adds support to handle PolicyRule App name and App service type match.
    For classifying app traffic install 2 rules:
     - Install rule matching on non classfied traffic(let it go through(or we'll never classify traffic)
     - Install rule with app name match (set by dpi)
    
    Changes table order so DPI goes before enforcement
    
    For Reporting rule stats also install 2 rules
     - One will match unmatched traffic from the rule and ignore it
     - One that matches classfied traffic for the rule and reports to sessiond
    
    Adds a new scratch reg for recording unclassified vs classified rule

    Fix small bug in Update revalidation timer (#1716)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1716
    
    ## Previous Behavior
    - UpdateSessionResponse can return `UsageMonitorResponse` for each (session, mkey). Since revalidation timers are session wide, we need only schedule a revalidation per session.
    - Previously before this fix, a revalidation timer for each monitor was being scheduled
    
    ## New behavior
    - Keep track of imsis that already have a revalidation timer scheduled, and only schedule a new revalidation timer if that IMSI is not already tracked
    
    ## Next Steps
    - I have to modify the revalidation timer call flow to take in both IMSI & SessionID since there can be multiple sessions per IMSI.

    Refactor LTE policy streaming to use StreamProvider RPC implementation (#1711)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1711
    
    This diff refactors the policy stream providers to use the LTE StreamProvider
    RPC implementation. This comes as a part of the effort to decompose the Orchestrator
    plugin into strictly RPC interfaces.
    
    Since we're leaving the existing StreamProvider plugin interface as is, for now
    we're only swapping in an implementation change. To do this, we need to define
    a stream provider for the LTE module that can handle multiple stream names, farming
    out the stream update request to the appropriate implementor (i.e. PolicyProvider).
    
    To avoid import cycles we move the subscriber stream provider to the lte plugin
    directory. Eventually the `legacy_stream_providers` directory will be deleted
    and we will create a service out of the plugin directory
    (mconfig builder, stream providers, etc.).

    Upgrade flow 0.125 (#648)
    
    Summary:

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/terragraph-nms/pull/276
    
    - Upgrade flow
    - Upgrade flow-types for express (changed exported names of `ExpressResponse` and `ExpressRequest` to match old format to minimize extra changes).
    - Add flow-types for react-dom
    
    Some of the identified flow errors should be looked into soon because they reveal unvalidated user input being parsed on the nodejs server and passed onto other services.

    Run eslint in symphony circleci (#638)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/638
    
    Run eslint in symphony circleCI. Also added a few entries to the .eslintignore that should have been there. Additionally had to change the relative paths in the eslint-config to deal with the fact that CircleCI checks out code into a "project/" directory instead of "symphony/", but this new path works regardless of the top-level directory name.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1705
    
    This diff updates the FEG VM, which was still using not dockerized version of FEG.
    
    Note that we do not need this VM for development or prod. But some external contributors are not able to run FEG easily on baremetal due to missing libraries to install docker or other issues with APT.
    
    Also, note that same behaviour may be achieved with ```install_gateway.sh```. But that script may require ubuntu 18.04. So this VM allows easy deployment of FEG

    The installed dependencies in external all live in the root directory. We need to add relay as a "declaration" - i.e. use the flow types, but don't check that they compile.
    
    Also add `prepend-file` to the relay compiler because it's used and needed but not listed, resulting in build errors. (It was probably fine in our directory since it's a dependency of another package).

    Fix bug where rules without proper credit are installed (#1701)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1701
    
    During rule installs, we remove rules that don't have valid credit attached to it. There was a regression to this feature, from what I can see from testing.
    
    There were two issues:
    1. we have to pass a reference to the vector so that the changes are propagated
    2.  std::remove_if just shuffles the elements so that elements that meet the predicate function are in the beginning of the vector. And the function returns the new end pointer.
    "A call to remove is typically followed by a call to a container's erase method, which erases the unspecified values and reduces the physical size of the container to match its new logical size."
    (See here for more info: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/remove)
    
    Note: I'll also add a unit test for this specific case, but I'm deferring for now because I'm trying to figure out another breakage.

    Add basic UI for scheduling workflows (#1684)
    
    Summary:
    Add 'Scheduled' tab to workflow UI
    
    New schedules are created in workflow definition tab. Once created, they can be updated or deleted in 'Scheduled' tab. Currently only enabled/disabled and cron string can be edited.
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1684
    
    Test Plan:
    Open workflow definition, expand `workflow1`. Last button in the bar should be `Create schedule` :

    Click the button, new modal window should appear:
    ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/492226/82323567-89aca480-99d8-11ea-90eb-742b6b35b9fc.png)
    Click `Submit`. Expanding the `workflow1`, last button should be `Edit schedule`.
    Click `Scheduled` tab, all schedules should appear:
    ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/492226/82323786-d7c1a800-99d8-11ea-89c1-4dbbe96d41ae.png)
    Highlight newly created schedule, updating and deleting should work as expected.
    If you set the cron expression to `0 * * ? * *`, new execution should appear every minute. Cron expressions are evaluated using [go cron library](https://github.com/robfig/cron) which in turn uses [Quartz expressions](http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.3.0/tutorials/tutorial-lesson-06.html)

    Add test for Charging Update fail on the command level (#1695)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1695
    
    FeG change:
    - In session proxy, if either the command level result code or MSCC level result code fails, we should propagate back the command level result code so we can act accordingly.
    
    ## Old Behavior
    If we receive a command level failure OR MSCC level failure we ignore the message
    ## New Behavior
    1. If we receive a command level failure AND it is 5XXX (permanent error code), we terminate the subscriber.
    2. If we receive a command level failure AND it is NOT 5XXX, we ignore the message
    3. If we receive a MSCC level failure, we ignore the message
    
    I'm still figuring out what to do in the following cases
    1. Command level: 2001, MSCC level 5XXX => Does this mean the subscriber should be terminated? Or do we remove the Gy Monitor relating to the message?
    2. Command level: 2001, MSCC level not-5XXX => ??
    
    This diff also includes a basic integration test to test the command level failure for Gy CCR/A-U.

    Only schedule revalidation for the subscriber that received the event trigger, not all subscribers (#1686)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1686
    
    # Background
    - For each CCR/A exchange, PCRF can send back a revalidation timer event trigger for the session. From the slightly roundabout way that we translate these CCA messages into session_manager.proto's `UpdateSessionResponse`, the revalidation timer is included in all of the `UsageMonitoringResponse`.
    ```message UpdateSessionResponse {
      repeated CreditUpdateResponse responses = 1;
      repeated UsageMonitoringUpdateResponse usage_monitor_responses = 3;
    }
    ```
    
    # Current behavior [bug]
    - If a revalidation timer is scheduled for one session, all existing sessions are forced to report.
    - In the current `schedule_revalidation` function, `SessionRead req;` includes all existing IMSIs. This means that all sessions are required to `check_usage_for_reporting` with forced reporting.
    - We also have an incorrect behavior where if a session has multiple usage monitors, we would wrongly schedule multiple revalidations instead of one.
    
    # What this diff does
    - When scheduling revalidation, only pass the imsi for which the session for.
    (For a more correct implementation, we should be specifying the sessionID + imsi, since a subscriber can have more than one session in some cases. This requires a bigger change, so I'll keep it this way for now)
    - If we receive multiple usage monitoring updates, only apply one of the event trigger as they will all be the same.

    Fix race on DB vs. state service view of registered indexers
    
    Summary:
    If state service gets indexer info for an indexer that is (no longer) registered, it can't call any of the indexer's methods (e.g. `GetVersion`), so it needs to skip reporting metrics for that indexer.
    
    This was a racy issue in the test code since, within a single test case, indexers are being successively registered and deregistered in the service-level registry, but the DB's understanding of the indexers is not reset over the course of a single test case.

    Gy CCR-I is expected with CCR-number AVP = 0 (#1678)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1678
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2431
    
    Gy CCR-I is expected with CCR-number AVP = 0, but under some conditions, we'll start it from 1.
    this diff fixes the issue. It also fixes the start # for Gx
    
    According to RFC (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4006#page-58):
       8.2.  CC-Request-Number AVP
    
       The CC-Request-Number AVP (AVP Code 415) is of type Unsigned32 and
       identifies this request within one session.  As Session-Id AVPs are
       globally unique, the combination of Session-Id and CC-Request-Number
       AVPs is also globally unique and can be used in matching credit-
       control messages with confirmations.  An easy way to produce unique
       numbers is to set the value to 0 for a credit-control request of type
       INITIAL_REQUEST and EVENT_REQUEST and to set the value to 1 for the
       first UPDATE_REQUEST, to 2 for the second, and so on until the value
       for TERMINATION_REQUEST is one more than for the last UPDATE_REQUEST.
    
    it should be OK to start from Req # 0 and use 1 with the first sessiond update

    This is the solution we come to term with alexsn for now.

    ```
    This is due to some other test failing and not cleaning up properly.
    So instead of asserting that all records are empty, just assert that all records for that IMSI are impty.
    
    Also move the "restart service" log to inside the RestartService function so we can log what service we're restarting

    Misc Qos related fixes
    
    Summary:
    We need to additionally patch ovs datapath debian to ensure that ovs meter implementation isn't broken.
    
    Also linux tc implementation's initial destroy method is too aggressive and tries to delete all possible qid's, additionally it doesn't handle exception. Fixed this by deleting only those Qids which are present and also added a test to verify this. Pipelined will fail without this fix since qos tc module will throw  an exception.
    
    Finally the qos_restart test modifies pipelined.yml file. However the existing ioutil write file doesn't sync the file. So it is possible to see pipelined yaml as a modified file post test if sync doesn't go through. Using a writeFileAndSync routine to do the same.

    fixed wrong arguments on test_local_enforcer (#1670)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1670
    
    create_credit_update_response was used with reversed arguments. The call to this function was not failing because those arguments were casted to the specific type (bool into unit64 and uint64 into bool).
    
    This diff reverses those arguments. Fortunately the tests seems to pass either way since all the tests were related with quota exhaustion, which meant the value was not important as long as it was lower than the used by the test.
    
    ```
    void create_credit_update_response(
      const std::string& imsi,
      uint32_t charging_key,
      uint64_t volume,
      bool is_final,
      CreditUpdateResponse* response);

    gc refactor (#616)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/616
    
    Rely on single proto schema for both graph (server) and jobrunner (client)
    There are two reasons why I do this change:
    1. Keeping the schema files in two places is a source for problems when we change things in one schema and not in the other one
    2. There is currently the following warning in tests that complain on this situation
    ```
    2020/05/12 19:23:41 WARNING: proto: message graph.Tenant is already registered
    
            previously from: "github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/graph/graphgrpc"
    
            currently from:  "github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/jobrunner"
    
    A future release will panic on registration conflicts. See:
    
    https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go/faq#namespace-conflict
    
    2020/05/12 19:23:41 WARNING: proto: message graph.TenantList is already registered
    
            previously from: "github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/graph/graphgrpc"

    A future release will panic on registration conflicts. See:
    
    https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/go/faq#namespace-conflict
    ```
    
    Also pay attention that I move the schema file to a subdirectory `schema`. The reason for that is that I didn't want jobrunner to contain all ent code and more that is inside `graphgrpc` and this way it depends on a much leaner package.

    Add docker-compose.metrics.yml env util
    
    Summary:
    Using the `docker-compose.metrics.yml` docker-compose file creates a shared volume, bound to the src/host's wkdir. This causes build.py to fail while the metrics compose is up.
    
    Thus, it's desirable to have an easy way to `down && build.py && up`. The easiest way to do this is to set the docker-compose env variable for the input files, then always doing `docker-compose down` before using build.py.
    
    Setting this env variable can now be done via `. compose-all.env`.

    Summary: Building all the images takes forever, and often just rebuilding the controller image is sufficient for certain development workflows. Adding this option back allows `build.py -c` to rebuild only the controller img, saving quite a bit of build time

    Fixed MME crash during UE context cleanup in S1ap Enb deregister indication for large number of UEs (#1657)
    
    Summary:
    If some test case fails because of some unexpected message when large number of UEs (issue found with at least 512 UEs) are attached with Magma MME, SCTP shutdown was triggered and MME was getting crashed when sending Enb deregister indication from S1ap to MME App. The reason for the crash was that the ITTI message was sent between the S1ap and MME app for this cleanup in chunk of 128 UEs, where the next chunk was created but a reference to old pointer was sent. This PR fixes the issue.

    Fix sessiondcrash on sync_sessions_on_restart (#1643)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1643
    
    `sync_sessions_on_restart` can add events on the event loop but was called before the event loop was attached to local enforcer. This can cause a sessiond crash when things are added to the event loop before initialization.
    changing that here so that it's called after the attach.

    3. To solve it add pagination to query each time only 1K
    4. Also add simple `PrintReporter` to be able to see the queries in action
    
    Pay attention: `get_locations` is super-slow. This should be a first step before further performance optimisations are applied

    Fix Revalidation Timer SessionD Crash (#1641)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1641
    
    ## Issue
    - When a revalidation timer was triggered sessiond would crash.
    - More Details here T58172385
    ## What was wrong
    - In `check_usage_for_reporting`, a callback function for usage reporting is defined. The problem was that the session_update variable was passed by reference not value. This meant that when the variable was cleared from the stack, the callback no longer held the correct values.
    
    ## Fix
    - Pass 'session_update' by make a shared_pointer out of a copied value.
    
    ## Note
    - When I was adding unit tests, I discovered that revalidation timers triggered by a CCA-Init is still broken. This is because when the revalidation is scheduled, the session information is not properly stored in session map/store yet. This I will fix in another diff because: 1. This needs a slightly bigger fix 2. This behavior doesn't happen very often.
    - When the feature is fixed, I'll enable the unit test for that case.

    Schedule termination for sessions that are awaiting termination on restart (#1634)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1634
    
    ## Background on the SESSION_TERMINATION_SCHEDULED state
    This state is only used for CWF currently. A session goes into this state when a session is initialized without a valid wallet. This usually means that the PCRF will not send down PCC rules to browse internet, and there is only the Zero-Rated rule installed. (ZR rule only allows access to a data purchasing site). We do not immediately reject the session creation in this scenario, since we want to allow the user to purchase data. Instead, we will schedule a termination in a configured amount of time. (The default is 30 seconds).
    
    ## On SessionD Restart
    When SessionD restarts and we re-load all sessions, we want to make sure that the user gets kicked off in some time. We can keep this logic dumb and always just use the configured kick off time. (So if a user gets scheduled to terminate at time T+30 and SessionD restarts at time T+15, the user will end up getting kicked off at time T+45. We can change this if we need to, for now this should be good enough.
    
    ## Some Bug Fix
    I realized when writing the unit test for this feature that I introduced a bug a few diffs ago. In `terminate_service` we should ignore the termination only if the session is already terminating, and not "not active". This is because "not active" also includes SESSION_TERMINATION_SCHEDULED.
    
    ## Summary of Changes
    - Add 'schedule_termination' to consolidate the scheduling logic
    - Add 'is_terminating' and 'get_state' to SessionState
    - In `sync_sessions_on_restart` schedule terminations for sessions with SESSION_TERMINATION_SCHEDULED
    - Add unit test

    Fixed memory leak for some sanity test cases (#1575)
    
    Summary:
    1. MME allocates memory for emm_attach_request_ies_t on reception of attach request message. For emergency attach, MME sends the attach reject and so memory needs to be freed.
    2. While sending Attach Accept in Downlink Nas Transport message; esm_message needs to be freed after encoding the Attach Accept message.
    3. While stopping 3489 timer; Need to free the memory allocated for timer callback function argument.
    4. While processing Esm Information message; memory was allocated during decoding of apn name; after processing the message, allocated memory needs to be freed
    5. S1ap timer arguments needs to be freed while stopping the s1ap timer
    6. While sending nas message from mme-app to s1ap; once message is posted to s1ap; memory allocated for nas message needs to be freed.
    7. MME was crashing while handling second Attach Request for same imsi received before Attach Accept message. As per specification new request needs to be deleted. MME is also deleting new contexts. later down the code, MME was trying to access deleted context.
    8.On reception of Attach Request message, emm_attach_request_ies_t  was allocated. While handling  second Attach Request for same imsi received before Attach Accept message. Need to free memory allocated for emm_attach_request_ies_t
    9. While handling S1ap complete reset message; in switch case, "break' was missing; so it was resulting MME to crash.

    Add MeteringReporter for reporting session traffic usage to orc8r from gateway (#2383)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2383
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1628
    
    Added a `MeteringReporter` class for reporting upload and download usage of each session to the orc8r. This object operates on the `SessionStateUpdateCriteria` struct, as this makes it convenient to report session traffic usage right before session updates are written back into persistent storage with `SessionStore`.

    Currently we use makefile to filter each file and run selective tests based on makefile target. This is unnecessary since we can directly use go build tags to do the same. Cleaning this up and getting rid of Makefile.

    We remove the prefixes from receiver names in routes on GETs in order to decrease confusion, but since the base route is special and not created by the user anyways, it doesn't need to be unsecured. This makes the GET/change/POST flow easier since you can POST exactly what you just received from the GET

    Track policy rule lifetimes for subscribers (#2259)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2259
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1533
    
    Policy rule lifetimes need to be tracked by `session_manager` so that on restart of the service, rules can be correctly installed and uninstalled in the future if they were scheduled to do so.
    
    This revision does not include the rescheduling of rule activation/deactivation upon service restart. That will come in a separate revision
    
    ## Changes
    - Add a `RuleLifetime` struct to more easily track policy rule lifetimes
    - `SessionState` tracks policy rule lifetimes, both for rules already installed, and those scheduled to be installed
    - `SessionState` methods modified so that any rule activations and tracking require also specifying the lifetime of the policy rule
    - Refactored `LocalEnforcer` to remove `process_create_session_response`, decomposing its functionality into a new method, `filter_rule_installs` and an existing method, `process_rule_installs`

    - It seems like `complete_termination` with no reporter parameter was only used for testing, so removing that function and using a mock reporter in the test
    - We were seeing "Encountered unexpected state ..." log on error level, when it's not really an error. Only log as an error when the state is ACTIVE, because that is an unexpected state. Log on INFO level for states `SESSION_TERMINATING_FLOW_ACTIVE` and `SESSION_TERMINATING_FLOW_ACTIVE`, so that it's clear the function is triggered by the scheduled callback.

    When network initiated bearer deactivation is executed for the default bearer, the context for the dedicated bearers in the same session must be also deleted and GTP tunnel rules must be removed. This was not done properly and the behavior is corrected with this diff.
    
    Diff fixes memory leak as well as duplicate tunnel rule deletion for default bearer (it is deleted once in the modified function and second in function call ```sgw_handle_sgi_endpoint_deleted(&sgi_delete_end_point_request, imsi64);```).

    Speed up prometheus label values endpoint on default (#1614)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1614
    
    After grafana was pushed to prod, we saw that the dashboards were not loading. This is because the dasbhoards make a request to the "label values" endpoint to get the list of available networkIDs, gatewayIDs, and maybe some others.
    
    In general this endpoint is pretty quick, however we had to reroute it in the API to enable multitenancy. This uses the "series" endpoint which is in general much slower.
    
    By default this queries from the beginning of time to the end, however since most metric series' existences don't change very often, it should be completely valid to restrict that search to a much smaller time span. In some experiments on prod with curl I saw massive speed improvements by just restricting the time (see test plan).
    
    Allowing start/end parameters keeps the flexibility for some edge cases where one might really need to query a longer time span.

    Update clock to support skipping time.Sleep calls.
    
    Summary: Our services supports async jobs (reindexing, metrics collection, etc) which run as interval-paced jobs. Testing these async jobs in a more e2e manner requires monkey-patching `time.Sleep` to sleep a negligible duration instead of the full batch interval.

    Clear flow rules during session termination for suspended UEs (#1613)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1613
    
    During CS Voice fallback, PS rules are suspended (i.e., drop rules are installed at higher priority than the GTP tunnel rules). When UE switches back to PS, PS rules are restored (i.e., drop rules are removed, therefore GTP tunnel rules regain priority). However, when UE is detached before a switch back request to PS, these drop rules were not deleted. Thus, everytime such an event sequence happens new drop rules accumulate on OVS. This situation was noticed when S1AP integ tests run more than once in a row as OVS test was failing due to unexpected number of flow rules. In production, this situation can potentially lead to service outage when an IP address with a non-deleted drop rule is allocated to the same or different UE in subsequent attaches. Since these rules persist against service restarts, such outages would be very probable when circuit switched fallback is used for voice calls.
    
    To fix this behavior, this diff deletes the drop rules for suspended users when they are detaching from the network.

    2. Broke the MembersList & GroupMemberViewer to reusable generic components - List, ListItem and MemberListItem with the specific usage at GroupMembersLis & GroupMembersListItem.
    
    It is all the same code - just
    1. Removed the group passed as meta-data and moved the membership check to the `GroupMemberListItem` - much more simple.
    2. Broke the MembersList to severa reusable components.
    
    This change allows me to use the exact same code for the groups search in the Policy card (next diff - D21250832),

    Multiple Diameter - Creation of Multiplex utility and refactor Session_Proxy (#1573)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1573
    
    In order to allow flexibility on how the subscribers are distributed across different diam connections, we add a new utility called ```Multiplexor```. This allows us to add different algorithms independently of the implementation of the Multiple service.
    
    Currently there is only one algo defined that distributes Subscribers across different PCRFs and OCSs based on their IMSI module (```IMSI%numServers```). But in the future we could have an algorithm that has more features like checking health of a connection or having some kind of memory.
    
    This diff also includes other refactors to improve readability on ```session_proxy```.
    
    This is the list of changes:
    - Creation of ```multiplex.go``` and ```multiplextest.go```
    - Modified "multiple_Session_proxy.go" to include a ```multiplex```
    - Modified  ```integ_tests/multi_sessioneproxy_test.go``` to use ```multiplex```
    - Moved ```GetValueOrEnvForIndexZero``` functions to ```diameter/conf.go```
    - Reorganized ```session_proxy/main.go```

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1607
    
    This diff fixes a bug causing sessiond to crash when not
    configured for carrier wifi support. This is due to the AAA client
    thread not running. This is fixed by updating the logic to only run
    the setup when stateless and configured for CWF.
    
    It also ensures that this request is only sent with non-empty sessions.

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1552
    
    - For restructuring MME tasks state to be per UE and be saved into redis to support state replication, this completes UE context restructure on S1AP task.
        - Adding `comp_s1ap_id` to s1ap ue context, which is a unique composite id between `sctp_assoc_id` and `enb_ue_s1ap_id` to identify an UE in S1AP context.
       - Updating `enb->ue_coll` to `enb->ue_id_coll` as S1AP UE context structs now is moved to separate hashtable
       - Adding write_to and read_from UE state functions to save UE context to redis

    Only schedule a termination callback if the session was previously active (#1599)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1599
    
    ## Background on session states
    Sessiond has multiple terminating states.
    The reason for this being that before we can send a CCR-T to PCRF/OCS, we need to collect ALL data usage reports relating to this session from pipelined.
    
    ```  SESSION_ACTIVE                        = 0,
      SESSION_TERMINATING_FLOW_ACTIVE       = 1,
      SESSION_TERMINATING_AGGREGATING_STATS = 2,
      SESSION_TERMINATING_FLOW_DELETED      = 3,
      SESSION_TERMINATED                    = 4,
    ```
    * When a session termination is started, sessiond will remove policy flows in pipelined. (TERMINATING_FLOW_ACTIVE). (AAA or MME is also notified at this point to kick off the user.)
    * In order for the termination to complete, sessiond has to wait for pipelined to finish reporting usage for the session.
    * Every time pipelined reports usage for the session, the state goes into `TERMINATING_AGGREGATING_STATS`.
    * Once the report for the session is done being processed, it goes back to `TERMINATING_FLOW_ACTIVE`.
    * NOTE  that If a report is received and there's no entry for the terminating session, the state transitions to  `TERMINATING_FLOW_DELETED` and the termination completes. This means that pipelined has cleaned up all flows relating to that session.
    
    * When the termination is started, sessiond will also schedule a callback function to force a termination in case pipelined does not finish reporting usage in time.
    
    * When either the callback is triggered or pipelined has cleaned all flows, sessiond will finally send a CCR-T to PCRF/OCS and complete the termination.
    
    ## What this diff fixes
    Before this change, we could have multiple termination callbacks scheduled. Since session credit has no visibility into what the Session wide FSM state is, so it could trigger multiple calls to `terminate_service`.
    
    The multiple callbacks do not cause any issues in connectivity etc, but it makes the log messy.
    This diff ensures that we only schedule one call back per termination.

    NMS Settings
    
    Summary:
    ## Summary:
    Allows admin users to edit the NMS environment-variable settings. This includes connection strings, hostnames for external services, etc.
    
    ## Technical:
    Settings are stored as JSON in the same format as the .env file (flat, all values are strings).
    
    ```
    {
     "LOG_LEVEL":"debug"
    }
    ```
    
    Settings stored in the JSON file are then used to override the settings which come from the .env file. My logic is this: the .env file is created once during deployment and often never changed. Then the user can change and override them to match their own setup.
    
    The order of precedence is so:
    cli vars <- nms settings <- env vars <- JS defaults
    
    CLI vars are always the highest precedence, this allows the admin to override or undo bad settings introduced via the settings page.
    
    After the settings file is saved to the disk, the NMS will either restart itself, or wait for nodemon to restart it.
    
    New settings can be added to the settings page by adding them to the list of registered settings in `server/settings/settings.js`. There are some basic validations to help the user configure properly. It's easy to add more in the future as the feature supports more settings.

    - Adding a unit test for this feature to cross off the item from CWF test coverage
    - When `FramedIPv4AddrRequiredEnv` and `DefaultFramedIPv4AddrEnv` are  set, the ip addr in the CCR should be overwritten, and no `FramedIPv6Prefix`  should be sent.

    Reorder assertions so that the test is more reliable (#1594)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1594
    
    For this test, since we generate traffic for >100% of the quota given to trigger the FUA, the test flow should be
    1. Setup expectation for CCR-I
    2. Trigger an authentication to trigger a CCR-I
    3. Assert expectations for CCR-I
    4. Setup expectation for CCR-T
    5. Generate traffic to trigger the FUA, which in this case is a terminate
    (Here it can take up to 5 seconds for the full termination to go through)
    6. Assert expectations for CCR-T
    7. Check pipelined usage to assert the record is gone.

    The platform-server service has the following values for roles:

    The graph service has the following values for roles:
    1. owner (like superuser)
    2. admin
    3. user (like user)
    
    Right now graph does the translation between roles. This prevents us to use the full range of roles in inter-service communication and also makes our testing complicated.
    So this diff changes the translation to be in platform-server

    Some log adjustments (#1585)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1585
    
    - remove "IMSI" from some logs because the imsi variable already contains the prefix
    - The log `MLOG(MDEBUG) << "Running update_sessions";` is slightly confusing because it sounds like it's talking about cloud updates when it is about session store
    - Some ReAuthAnswer result conversion so that it's easier to understand

    Multiple diameter (integ_test) - Test to check UE control data flows through the right PCRF and OCS (#1553)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1553
    
    This is a basic tests with the new set up of  2 PCRF and 2 OCS.
    The UE gets configured only in one of those PCRF and OCS instances based on its IMSI.
    The test consists on single UE sending 500k, reporting to PCRF and OCS and detaching.
    The objective is to make sure the data flows through the right instances.
    
    Some generic issues that may need further investigation:
    - For some reason OCS and PCRF seems to get the subscribes accounts deleted even before we send the detach. This prevents the credit to be reported properly
    - UESim uses only one MAC address, so it is not possible to send traffic from more than one UE. So any tests is currently limited to one single UE in data plane

    User property
    
    Summary:
    Option to set a user to a property.
    
    **Note: there's a small downside to this approach. When you first select a user from the dropdown, its email is displayed. When you then refresh the work order you will see the user's name. This is because all the property related components are not using fragments. So I couldn't use them in order to fetch the email field just for the `User` `NamedNode`**

    Null check on axios response (#549)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/549
    
    The axios error response is not guaranteed to have a "response" field, so we should check if it exists before referencing it.
    
    Motivation: There's a weird error where axios is throwing during some call, however every call is in a try/catch block. My hunch is that the reference of `error.response.status` is throwing inside the error block because `error.response` doesn't exist.

    When only one server is configured, there is no need to use ```NewCentralSessionControllers``` (with an S)
    
    With this diff when only  one server is configured (that s the most common casse), we will keep using the same type we were using ```NewCentralSessionController``` (no s).

    Add load criteria to Search in support of ListKeysByNetwork.
    
    Summary:
    ## Rationale
    
    State indexers' reindex method needs to pass all known state, independent of network, through the indexer to be reindexed. We currently have no way to get a list of all state/state IDs in a cross-network context. `ListKeysByNetwork` us the hook to get cross-network state IDs, which can then be converted to state on a per-network basis via the normal methods.
    
    ## Implementation
    
    The easiest way to get all keys is to use the existing `Search` method, so we
    - update `Search` to (a) allow nil network filters and (b) function correctly when all filters are nil (return all blobs)
    - update `Search` to support a load criteria -- in this case, whether to load blob values
    - add a default method `ListKeysByNetwork` as a wrapper around `Search` with nil filters and a "no values" load criteria

    Add reindex job queue for cross-controller coordination. (#1511)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1511
    
    Unordered job queue for implemented using the `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` clause available in Postgres and Maria.
    
    ## Cross-controller coordination
    
    Populating the job queue is an exactly-once operation. We handle this in two parts
    
    - <= 1 -- the job queue jobs are written as part of a tx that checks the "stored" indexer versions, and these stored versions are updated the the "desired" versions during the same tx, ensuring no more than one controller instance will write to the job queue per code push
    - >= 1 -- this work is best suited for a future where we have a message broker in the orc8r, so for now each controller warning-logs either success or failure to write to the job queue, and manual inspection of the logs would be required (thankfully, we also have tests to ensure this doesn't happen in the expected case)

    Add stop functionality to GRE probe for CWAG health service (#1557)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1557
    
    When a CWAG is demoted, we block ICMP on the eth1
    interface to ensure that traffic will properly be re-routed.
    Due to this, the ICMP GRE probe will always fail when a gateway
    is in standby. This causes the gateway to appear unhealthy.
    To avoid this, we stop the probe on gateway demotion and start
    the probe on gateway promotion.

    Fix errors in writing Auth Info Procedure to redis
    
    Summary:
    When `use_stateless` flag is set to true in mme.yml, `test_resync.py` fails as
    the state is not written into redis correctly. This change fixes the conversion
    of EMM CN procedures to proto messages. Other minor fixes:
    - adds missing enb_s1ap_id_key field in the UE context
    - replace strncpy with memcpy
    - typos

    Multiple diameter (integ_test) (2/3) - Add second scenario for integ_test for OCS2 and PCRF2 (#2296)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2296
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1528
    
    Added a second scenario to fab file to be able to run MultiSessionProxy tests.
    
    Modified makefile:
    - To prevent MultiSessionProxy when ```make integ_test``` is run we will use golang build tags: MultiSessionProxy tests files will include ```//build !main_integration``` at the top of the file that will prevent its execution when ```make integ_test``` is called.
    - To run MultiSessionProxy tests we will have to call ```make multi_session_proxy``` (fab file will take care of set up the right environment for that that)
    
    Modified fab file:
    - Added new scenario after the main integ_test is done
    - Modified ```_run_integ_tests``` not to clean up in case of success (```clean_up``` will be run at the very end, if we get there)
    - Added conditions to run the test by name: MultiSessionProxy will be executed with proper scenario if we run```fab integ_test``` or ```fab integ_test:test_to_run=multi_session_proxy```

    Summary: The `networkID` and `gatewayID` variables are fairly difficult to set up correctly, and a user would have a hard time figuring out how to do this if they wanted that feature in a custom dashboard. By providing a template which has a single graph (for variable usage demo), users can simply copy this template then build their dashboard off of this base.

    Summary:
    https://fb.workplace.com/groups/499722490751106/permalink/601294677260553/
    
    - When querying through graphql - there's a middleware to take ids and convert int to string.
    - On direct rest calls (like the export) this does not happened. and therefore on properties Input (which by the models, requires an id) this failed.
    
    **EDIT: I thought it might be better to remove the ID altogether, less confusing.**
    
    Made the client send ints as IDs (the server ignores them, it's randomly generated either way)

    Fixing defect caused by D20986647.
    
    This is a patch fix (changing to '-' instead of '_' when concatanating `node` & type (since there are types with '_' in their name and it cause failure).
    
    Need to have some smarter implementation (at least for this part, didn't go over the whole diff).
    Suggesting making the `Select` component supporting an `Object` value (and not just `string`).

    Show inventory or magmalte depending on configured tabs
    
    Summary:
    If a tenant has 'inventory' or 'workorders' tabs - show inventory UI otherwise magmalte.
    The difference between the system is that each show a different Administrative tool page right now but can potentially change the look of more components.
    
    Also for easier local testing I created two local environment systems for us:
    1. fb-test that is configured to have 'inventory' and 'workorders' UI and thus will show inventory UI
    2. magma-test that is configured to have 'nms' and 'automation' UI and thus will show Magma UI
    
    Also I made inventory consistent with magmalte and presented settings page from admin tab (that makes more sense than showing it from inventory page)
    
    This should be a short term fix and we should either merge the different implementations for user management or split them all together

    If Redis is ever unavailable, the service_restart_stats function produces

    Dedup Redirection Address Type enum definitions in protobuf (#1520)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1520
    
    We had the exact same enum defined in `policydb.proto` and `session_manager.proto`.
    Since `session_manager.proto` already uses protobuf definitions from `policydb.proto`, deduping the definition and using the one in `policydb.proto` instead.
    
    We stream convert policies to protobuf every time we stream, and the gateway receives streamed policies every second or so, we shouldn't need a data migration for this type change

    Round 2: add Python protobuf typings for code completion via mypy-protobuf. (#1464)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1464
    
    Supersedes D20854672, which was unlanded.
    
    ## Implementation
    Preburn mypy-protobuf pip-install to python_dev VM image, and update agw Vagrantfile to point to new image.
    
    ## Rationale
    The Python-generated proto code sucks in terms of developer ergonomics because it generates an ~opaque metaclass, instead of generating the classes directly as in e.g. Go. This precludes straightforward code completion, makes reading through code impossible, and I personally always struggle with the documentation for the Python generated code.
    
    This diff solves one of those three gripes--we now have access to intelligent code completion for Python protobuf code. The mypy-protobuf [0] package is installed via pip, and outputs `.pyi` files in the same directory as our generated Python proto code.
    
    ## Consumption
    IntelliJ automatically consumes these `.pyi` files and provides completion based off them--it may need an `Invalidate Caches / Restart` run first, though.

    Update gateway_go image to build radius binary (#1513)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1513
    
    This diff updates the dockerfile at magma/feg/gateway/docker/go
    to include building the radius binary. Since the radius server is in
    golang this is an easy inclusion. This gives us:
    
    1. Less images to build and publish for the CWAG
    2. Closer to all bionic base images for the CWAG
    3. Closer to a magma style of running for radius (binary, template, configs locations)
    
    The radius dockerfile will be deleted in a later diff.

    Change graphql entities in Property to NamedNode interface (#496)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/496
    
    I want to make Properties generic and not dependent on location, equipment, service, etc. so it can later be used by other services and with other node types.
    
    How it works ?
    * PropertyType can have `type` "node" and nodeType of `equipment`,`location` etc.
    * Property exports only `nodeValue` of graphql interface `NamedNote`

    Disable flaky test_async_service (#1507)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1507
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2235
    
    Occasionally, `test_async_service` will flake. The best working theory here is that things are still being scheduled on the "server completion queue" after it is shutdown. This issue only crops up when running this unit test and should not happen during actual operation of `session_manager`. Disabling this unit test unless somebody else wants to dig into the issue.

    Summary:
    Grafana was crashlooping on staging. The logs provide 0 information so the only thing that makes sense is a lack of resources as per https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd2/issues/1747.
    
    I'm setting these resources as the defaults on the chart values since we don't want users to run into this when they deploy.

    Fix flaky integration test
    
    Summary:
    TestQosDowngrade test can be flaky because it depends on when CCA update kicks in. Removed an additional test and increased the threshold at which CCA can kick in. Also i found that adding the additional --get-server-output seems to be causing the iperf to get stuck. Not entirely sure why it is happening. Running tcpdump on both ends seem to reveal that the towards the end when server sends a large packet that never reaches iperf client. For now we don't use this functionality, hence i disabled it. I ran it couple of times after disabling --get-server-output and iperf client wasn't getting stuck.
    
    Attaching the dump here in case anyone is interested in taking a look

    Upgrade babel-eslint to latest for archon, fbc, & fbc-mobile-app
    
    Summary:
    `babel-eslint` is the parser you can supply to ESLint based off of Babel.
    
    `babel-eslint` 10.1.0 is the newest production version of `babel-eslint`.
    In this diff, I tackle updating the packages in Xplat that were already on the 10.x line, other than those in `xplat/js`.
    There are very few changes between 10.0.1 (the lowest previous version) and 10.1.0. There are only 3 non-version-bump commits: 2 bug fixes and enabling parsing of Flow enums.
    I will tackle the several projects currently using `babel-eslint` older than 10.x in Xplat, and things under `xplat/js`, in separate diffs.

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/491
    
    When running behind a reverse proxy, Grafana needs to know the root url that it will be accessed from. For the NMS, that is `/grafana`.
    
    In staging grafana just shows an error which is due to this not being configured correctly in the helm chart

    Implement CWAG health interfaces with specific health implementations (#1480)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1480
    
    This diff implements the interfaces defined in the previous diff.
    For GRE we use an ICMP probe that determines unhealthy if all endpoints are
    unreachable. For service status, we utilize docker's health check to ensure
    that every critical service (those that have checks), are healthy. For system
    stats we use psutil to fetch memory and cpu.
    
    For disable - we utilize iptables to block ping on eth1. This ensures that
    the AP/WLC will detect the primary tunnel as down and use the secondary tunnel
    (the newly promoted active).
    
    For enable - we remove the icmp drop rule and then restart sessiond. This
    will kick of the initialization sequence to get the gateway in a ready state.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1428
    
    Sessiond recycles sessions if a session exists with the right WLAN RAT type or exact configuration. When the session is in a transitional state to terminate, it creates a bug where session is deleted while MME thinks that the session still exists. This change does not recycle sessions in transitional state.

    Fix missing .deb - bad filename generated by fpm for python webcolors 1.11.0 (#1477)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1477
    
    ```pydep``` script uses  ```fpm``` command to generate the .deb files. For some reason when generating the deb for webcolors version 1.11.0 the comes wrong:
    
    ```python3-webcolors_1.11_all.deb```
    instead of
    ```python3-webcolors_1.11.0_all.deb```
    
    That prevents the auto update of magma on AGW.
    
    Since the issue is on fpm, which is a third party command, we can only bypass the issue. For that reason I am changing the version from ```1.11.0``` to ```1.11.1```
    
    An issue on fpm github team will be open to warn about this.
    
    Note this dependency it is not needed at AGW level, that is why I am removing it form there.

    Make all redis clients use address configured in redis.yml (#1451)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1451
    
    For CWF we need the ability to read from a remote redis server.
    Currently, all redis clients in the magma codebase use localhost without
    any available configuration. This diff adds a `bind` field (following
    redis notation) to allow that field to be changed.

    Add RedisStoreClient for persistent storage of SessionState
    
    Summary:
    This revision is part of a series of changes to make session_manager stateless.
    
    The `RedisStoreClient` is implemented with some assumptions that should always hold:
    1) `SessionStore` is always run in the main `EventBase` thread, so only one of its methods is executing at once
    2) Writes of `RedisStoreClient` can be assumed to be happening atomically
    3) Nothing other than `session_manager` can read the Redis table holding session state
    
    If these assumptions hold, then these guarantees can be provided:
    1) `read_sessions` will always return a set of sessions with sane state
    2) The Redis table holding session state should always have a sane view of session state which can be recovered from

    Add serialization/deserialization functions for session state to enable read/write from Redis
    
    Summary:
    This revision is part of a series of changes to make session_manager stateless.
    
    This revision adds serialization and deserialization functions that will let `SessionState` and `SessionMap` easily be written into a key-value store like Redis. This serde step sits on top the marshal/unmarshal step to convert `SessionState` to `StoredSessionState`.
    
    The intention here was to have the `StoredState` structs be used for getters and setters of various state of `session_manager`, and then have various adapters to write such `StoredState` into different storage.

    This revision is part of a series of changes to make session_manager stateless.
    
    ## Changes
    - `LocalSessionManagerHandler will not hold a reference to the global `SessionMap`, and will instead access this state through the `SessionStore` interface
    - Updates to the `SessionStore` are done sparingly, keeping the state there in a consistent state from which `session_manager` service will be able to restart
    - Updated many unit tests to reflect the changes

    This revision should not be landed by itself. Landing this change without the relevant changes for `LocalSessionManagerHandler` also will cause breakages.

    - `SessionProxyResponderHandler` uses `SessionStore` instead of global `SessionMap`
    - Addition of `test_proxy_responder_handler` which verifies that in policy re-auth, pipelined is called, and that the handler correctly modifies what's stored in the session

    Creating generic scheduling components
    
    Summary:
    Network test and IM Scan service both need a scheduler. to keep things consistent, and not write the same code twice, this generic scheduler modal will enable us to use the same scheduler across the nms. By passing in props to the scheduler, we can use it for adhoc only situations as well as scheduling future runs of any cron based execution we wish to do in the future.
    
    The timing portion at the bottom half of the scheduler modal is constant no matter what props are passed in.
    
    The param portion in the top half accepts a React.node for type selector, and then another React.node for advanced params.
    
    The schedule or start button allows for two separate functions to be executed based on what the user selected. The parent component is responsible for providing functions to execute a submit or schedule, with the schedule prop function accepting a cronstring as an input.

    Add react-relay to the hub ui page and execute a simple "get version" query against the hub graph server.
    
    For now the hub graph server is on localhost, eventually it will be deployed in the cluster and I'll change the code to reflect that.
    
    Since we're using federation I've chosen to copy over the schema from introspecting the federated server. One option we discussed is concatenating the schema files but this ends up being pretty hard since they're not all in the same folder - there are different schema folder / files for every service that is being federated. Later we'll make a more robust solution for this.

    Wait 1s before shutdown of grpc completion_queue in tests to wait out race condition (#2202)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2202
    
    `test_async_service` has been failing due to a race condition, usually with the error:
    ```
    completion_queue.cc:512]    assertion failed: cq_event_queue_num_items(&cqd->queue) == 0
    ```
    
    The working theory here is that the completion queue is getting modified after shutdown, probably since something is still running in the EventBase thread.
    
    Added a 1s wait after calls to handlers of `session_manager` before shutdown of completion queues.

    Add Python protobuf typings via mypy-protobuf.
    
    Summary:
    For the purpose of IDE code completion.
    
    ## Rationale
    The Python-generated proto code sucks in terms of developer ergonomics because it generates an ~opaque metaclass, instead of generating the classes directly as in e.g. Go. This precludes straightforward code completion, makes reading through code impossible, and I personally always struggle with the documentation for the Python generated code.
    
    This diff solves one of those three gripes--we now have access to intelligent code completion for Python protobuf code. The mypy-protobuf [0] package is installed via pip, and outputs `.pyi` files in the same directory as our generated Python proto code.
    
    ## Consumption
    IntelliJ automatically consumes these `.pyi` files and provides completion based off them--it may need an `Invalidate Caches / Restart` run first, though.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1439
    
    - During updates of D19793320, on `s1ap_mme_handle_path_switch_request` mme_ue_s1ap_id was getting removed after being freed by function call to `s1ap_remove_ue`, this fixes it by removing removal of ue id on `s1ap_remove_ue` function.
    - For `s1ap_mme_handle_path_switch_request`, as ue_id will remain the same, the update of ue_id => IMSI is removed.

    Update operator to use GRPC for health status fetching (#1452)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1452
    
    This diff serves as the final major diff needed to implement
    active/standby support for the cwf-operator. This diff adds a GRPC client
    that connects to each CWAG's local health service. This service is
    exposed by a new k8s service in the cwf helm chart.
    
    Included in this diff is a modification of the HAClusterStatus type
    which now tracks both active and standby init state. This is needed
    as the standby must have ICMP disabled on eth1 (interface to WLC)
    to ensure requests are routed to the proper CWAG.

    Delete all graph data between runs with grpc call (#481)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/481
    
    What does it do:
    * Initialise client once and use in all tests
    * in `setUp` call grpc endpoint to delete the tenant information and also clear catalog cache
    
    What the impact:
    1. No need to take care of deleting data created (less code to write and maintain)
    2. Tests are now isolated. failure in one test doesn't affect all other tests
    3. Tests are running much faster now (deletions are faster & also. initialising clients is only down once)
    
    before:
    ```
    Ran 33 tests in 178.079s
    ```
    after:
    ```
    Ran 33 tests in 99.104s
    ```
    
    Disadvantages:
    1. Remove mode of running on staging production (since I can't delete staging this way right now)

    Implement Cloud Connection cache & prevent potential connections leakage (#2174)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2174
    
    Implement Cloud Connection cache & prevent potential connections leakage.
    Many Magma services are using CreateCloudConnection() to RPC  a cloud service. Some call the function per every RPC and never close the connection, some create & close connection with every RPC call.
    We need to reuse connection to 1) prevent connection leakage from services which never clean up and 2) prevent running out of FDs due to high calls rate even for services which clean up the connection.

    Add active/standby logic to CWF operator (#1432)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1432
    
    This diff implements the main reconcilation logic needed for
    the CWF Operator. This works by tracking the current active
    gateway. Each reconcilation each we fetch health status.
    
    If the active is unhealthy and the standby is healthy, we
    trigger a failover. As a part of this, we track initialization
    status, to ensure that the new active is in a proper state
    (i.e sessions reloaded).
    
    The actual implementation of obtaining health status
    comes from a future diff that implements a local health
    services. This diff will be updated with parsing that
    status after that diff is finished.

    Default Grafana Dashboards for NMS (#404)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/404
    
    Creates default dashboards that mirror the original nms dashboards. These include variables to select on `networkID` and `gatewayID` in the same way that the NMS dashboards do, except these allow the selection of multiple networks at once.
    
    To deal with updates to the dashboard, they are overwritten on every sync and are not editable. If a user wants to modify the dashboard they can copy it and modify the copy.
    
    **Update**: The problem with the first iteration was that the dependency was added under `devDependencies` and as such it wasn't included in the prod build.

    Move parse IMSI from sessionId to a centralized location (#1423)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1423
    
    In order not to have defined in different places how to parse IMSI from sessionID we will
    add the code to feg protos package.
    
    Since sometimes engineers need different output format for the IMSI depending on where they are
    using the value, We have created 2 different functions to parse the imsi from sessionID. One returns
    the plain IMSI (only numbers in string format), the other return imsi number plus the prefix IMSI
    (this is the sessiond imsi format)

    Bump nghttpx version to 1.40.0 and migrate client cert patch for cloud proxy

    - When GRPC requests spun for a long time (somewhere around the 3-5 minute mark), we would see nghttpx crash with an assertion error
    ```
    shrpx_http2_session.cc:787: int shrpx::Http2Session::resume_data(shrpx::Http2DownstreamConnection*): Assertion `state_ == CONNECTED' failed.
    ```
    - This results in all gateways losing any persistent connections they have with the cloud proxy, syncRPC streams being the most affected:
    
    ```

    - This diff bumps nghttpx to 1.40.0 from 1.31.1 and migrates our patch for long client cert SN's. See https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/pull/1455 for the upstream fix PR.
    - As part of the fix, proxy's base image has been bumped to bionic because nghttp2 will no longer compile on xenial: https://github.com/nghttp2/nghttp2/issues/1345.
    - The proxy Dockerfile now builds nghttpx from source instead of installing from our JFrog repo via apt-get; in the future, we should get rid of anywhere we pull that package

    * When we recycle session for sessiond, we need to make sure we update the existing config with the new one in the request.
    * Will add the stateless sessiond part next
    
    Some notes for the future
    * There are some Event Triggers that we should be watching out for here.
       * TimeZone Change: If the new AP is in a different timezone, we have to notify the core. We don't have a way of supporting this right now as the LocalCreateSessionRequest doesn't include any timezone info. (We need this for the TimeZone AVP later on, so we can support this change)
       * IP CAN CHANGE: If the UE ipv4 changes, we need to notify the PCRF/OCS.
    * We will also need to add a call to pipelined to update the APN info.

    Convert version to uint32 and add test utils.
    
    Summary:
    ## Version size
    
    To simplify storing the indexer version in Postgres/Maria, we cap the version for now at uint32 so it can fit in their default integer type. Future updates can, if desired/necessary, change to e.g. uint64 and add migration for Postgres/Maria to convert to their respective types.
    
    Note: we'll be storing uint32 from Go into Postgres/Maria int32. For our purposes, this is fine. Will document in diff up the stack.
    
    For future reference, how to store numeric types in our db layers.
    
    Store as uint32:
    - Postgres requires using the signed `BIGINT` type [(ref)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25734871/how-do-i-store-an-unsigned-int-in-postgres-sql)
    - Maria has an `INT UNSIGNED` type which is exact match [(ref)](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/int/)
    
    Store as uint64:
    - Postgres requires using the (slow) `NUMERIC` type [(ref)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21909027/postgres-data-types-how-to-store-uint64-in-postresql)
    - Maria has a `BIGINT UNSIGNED` type which is exact match [(ref)](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/bigint/)
    
    ## Test utils
    
    We want the ability to generate nullipotent indexers with specified indexer ID and version. We also want to be able to register updates to indexer versions from tests.

    Session Manager's SessionStore supports deletion of sessions (#1407)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1407
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2144
    
    This revision adds supports deletion of sessions to the `SessionStore` interface. Of note is the grouping of the deletion functionality into the `update_session` method. The reason for this is that each method of the interface is intended to appear atomic to the rest of the `sessiond` service, and as updates & deletions are done at the same time when credit usage is reported, then it makes sense to group this together.

    Session Manager's SessionMap ownership changed from LocalEnforcer to global
    
    Summary:
    This large revision is a refactor as a stepping stone towards the `LocalEnforcer` using the storage interface, `SessionStore`, rather than its privately held `session_map_` field. For now, the `session_map` will be passed around as a reference, and owned by the service as a whole, rather than just the `LocalEnforcer`. No functional difference is created with this diff.
    
    Afterwards, it is intended that the two handlers will only be responsible for receiving incoming gRPC requests, and handing them off to `LocalEnforcer`, which will make reads from the `SessionStore`, and then make updates as necessary back to the `SessionStore` interface. Under this new model, concurrently handled gRPC requests will be handled with two separate `SessionMap` structs that are passed around, one for each gRPC request. Though they may be out of sync with each other, potential issues are resolved at the `SessionStore` level, as `SessionStateUpdateCriteria` is checked for validity before updating storage. If an update is invalid, then the gRPC request is deemed to be out of date, and should fail.
    
    ## Changes
    - `LocalEnforcer` no longer owns a `SessionMap` field
    - `SessionMap` is owned by the main thread and references are passed around
    - `LocalSessionManagerHandler` and `SessionProxyResponderHandler` both own references to the `SessionMap`
    - Updates to unit tests to reflect these changes

    RENAME: FormValidationContext -> FormAlertsContext
    
    Summary:
    Just renaming and re-arranging code in the new FormAlertsContext.js (moving functions up and down).
    No single change in logic.
    
    Plus, added the new `FormContext` which is just a wrapper for the DS `FormAlertsContext`.
    This wrapper is needed since `FormAlertsContext` is defined in DS and cannot have Symphony internal logic. It currently have ReadOnly enforcement in it which is wrong. In next diff I'll move this logic to the `FormContext` wrapper.
    
    Next stage will be handling the new Permissions system enforcement in `FormContext`.

    When RAR message omits protocol number in the packet filter rules, by default value 0 is used. Since OVS performs exact match rather than wildcarding 0 value, we skip matching on the IP protocol if generic IP proto (i.e., 0) is used in the next header.

    Add option to only run Gx tests, Gy tests, Authentication tests (#1391)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1391
    
    Since we now have a lot of tests and it's not always useful to run all of the tests every time, I've added subcommands to the fabfile so we can run Auth/Gx/Gy tests separately.
    
    This will be helpful when we start writing/testing Gy so we don't have to run the Gx tests every time.
    
    When the param is not specified, it will just run all the tests.
    CI will still continue to run all the tests as well.

    Clean up all integration tests (#1378)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1378
    
    * Add test description to `auth_test.go` and `auth_ul_test.go`
    * Consolidate cleaning into a defer function
    * Use `tr.WaitForPoliciesToSync()` instead of sleep for waiting for policies to sync up to sessiond
    * Use `tr.WaitFortr.WaitForEnforcementStatsToSync()` instead of sleep for waiting for enforcement stats to sync
        * Note these functions above uses sleeps to sync. But I want to keep the number of seconds consistent. I will eventually load these values from the config so that they're consistent with the configs
    * Use `tr.WaitForReAuthToProcess()` for after generating traffic to wait for updates from pipelined.
        * For this one, I'll brainstorm the best way to figure out when ReAuth has processed. Once sessiond states are stored in Redis, maybe we can use that to look into ReAuth states...

    Fix ASR bug by adding sessionID to CreateSessionResponse (#1373)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1373
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2024
    
    Currently the AAA server sets AcctSessionID to
    the CreateSessionResponse's sessionID. When receiving an ASR
    the AAA server doesn't check if ASR SessionID == AcctSessionID
    if either the ASR SessionID or AcctSessionID is empty. As a result,
    any ASR will terminate a current session, even if that session isn't
    the one the ASR was intended for.
    
    To fix this, we set SessionID in Session Proxy to ensure
    that the AAA server's acct session ID is not empty.

    Fix clang-format file to position braces and parameters correctly (#1341)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1341
    
    We would like to follow the prevalent C++ style guidelines in our C/C++ code
    formatting. This change fixes the clang-format style file as follows:
    - In class/funtion definitions, put opening brace on the same line as the
      function/class name
    - In function declarations/definitions/calls pack the parameter/arguments in as
      few lines as possible
    - In class definitions, break line before the colon if the inheritance list
      doesn't fit in one line
    - In constructor initialization, break line before the colon if the initializers
      don't fit in one line
    - Horizontal whitespace fixes, such as space before trailing comments and using
      4 spaces for continuation lines
    This is a preview diff to highlight the changes. Future diffs will apply the
    format to entire oai/ directory.

    Session_proxy Multidiameter - addition of multiple_session_controller layer (#1337)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1337
    
    In order to support multiple PCRFs and OCSs we are adding a wrapper around Control Session to hold many control Sessions.
    
    We will use IMSI to decide what controller each subscriber is being sent. Each controller will always point to the same PCRF and OCS, so the subscribers will always use the same controller. The algorithm right now is consists on a simple module of NumberControllers.
    
    MultipleCentralSessionController vs CentralSessionController
    - CreateSession and TerminateSession come from AGW on single requests per IMSI so Multiple controller just call the specific Create or Terminate session on the specific controller for that IMIS
    
    - UpdateRequests come in batches and includes multiple IMISs and can contain multiple Gx and Gy requests. To avoid having to recreate the proto file per each controller, instead we pass the original request to all controllers. We also pas a map of request per Session controller. Each controller will only send those request included in their own map
    
    Note that if we have one single controller all requests will be sent through the same controller

    Removing check for maximum number of connected eNodeBs
    
    Summary:
    The MME sends an S1SetupFailure if the number of connected eNodeBs exceeds the
    max_enbs (MAXENB in mme.conf.template). This is an inaccurate check as the
    max_enbs value only controls the number of lists maintained in internal
    hashtable for eNodeB descriptors. It does not limit the actual size of
    the hashtable. This change removes the above logic.

    Modify omnipresent rule test to use expectation based PCRF (#1366)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1366
    
    - Modify omnipresent rule test to use expectation based PCRF
    
    Test Summary
    - Insert two static rules into the DB. (static-block-all and omni-pass-all)
    - The omnipresent rule, with higher priority than the block all, will be set as omnipresent/network-wide.
    - Set an expectation for a CCR-I to be sent up to PCRF, to which it will respond with a rule install (static-block-all). Generate traffic and assert the CCR-I is received. Assert that the traffic goes through. This means the network wide rules gets installed properly.
    - Trigger a Gx RAR with a rule removal for the block all rule. Assert the
      answer is successful. Since the only rule with a usage monitor is removed,
      the session will terminate. Assert that policy usage is empty.

    Setting correct fileType for SiteSurveys images v2 (#368)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/368
    
    **Problems**
    - Images where give the FileType = FILE since we were incorrectly checking for mimeTypes in the fileType field.
    - We were calling questionFormat.toString() on a nil questionFormat
    - We assume that because the questionFormat is PHOTO there's photoData available
    - We don't pass the image mimeType down to the server
    
    **Solutions**
    - Set FileType = IMAGE when adding an Image
    - Check if questionFormat != nil before accessing this field
    - Check if photoData != nil before accessing this field
    - Hard-code the contentType until we find a way to pass it down to the server
    
    **Note**
    - Set the contentType to "image/jpeg" for now. I'll implement this correctly in a future Diff

    Add support for fragments in graphql compiler (#417)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/417
    
    Now you can define fragment files and use them in query\mutation files.
    It increase readability and reduce room for errors.
    In next diff, I'll utilise its biggest power though and remove the our usage of Dicts in code and use Fragment objects instead
    This diff doesn't change any functionality just refactor

    Add "Dynamic Strategy" as a passport strategy
    
    Summary:
    The OIDC strategy that comes with openid-client requires some attributes that
    we only have access to at request time.  To work around that (so we dont have to
    maintain our own strategy), I'm adding this DynamicStrategy which makes it
    so we just create the substrategy at runtime.  It's kind of hackish, but it's
    preferable to maintaining our own fork for multitenancy

    OVS: Add support for white spaces in command line argments.
    
    Summary:
    Currently OVS does not allow any space in arguments.
    That forces us to add a hack to replace space with '_'. This patch make it cleaner to handle it.
    User needs to provide double quotes to ovs-ofctl command parameters with white space. APN_NAME field does not store double quotes in the buffer. It is added in dump-flow output if APN_NAME has spaces in it.

This is a placeholder, and later the form will include more options and actually do stuff. This is fine to include in Symphony now because we need to explicitly enable the tab for a tenant to see it, so it won't interfere with current tenants.

    Add directoryd custom indexer for {session ID -> IMSI}.
    
    Summary:
    This diff doesn't actually run the indexer yet (next diff).
    
    ## Tl;dr
    We desire a non-hacky way to translate session IDs to IMSIs at the controller. This diff provides a state indexer implementation that produces this mapping and exposes it via the directoryd service.
    
    ## Context
    The FeG sends abort-session requests to the controller, which need to get translated to an IMSI. We don't have a good way of doing this right now, so the FeG sends the session ID as a concatenation of the IMSI and session ID.
    
    Instead, this diff utilizes our new StateIndexer interface and plugin element to do generate this mapping asynchronously.
    
    The StateIndexer type is intended to be run in a goroutine from the state service on new state updates (next diff).
    
    ## This indexer
    This sessionIDToIMSI indexer consumes directoryd records, which contain `{imsi -> {location records...}}` state, and produces `{session ID -> IMSI}` mappings it then stores via directoryd servicers.
    
    Generating mappings via the indexer: `state service -(async)-> indexer -> directoryd servicer`
    Consuming mappings via directoryd: `directoryd servicer -> requesting service`
    
    ## FeG use-case overview

    Session Manager's SessionState class accepts UpdateCriteria structs in its methods (#2047)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2047
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1327
    
    This revision adds the optional argument of `SessionStateUpdateCriteria` to methods of `SessionState` which modify its state. The plan here is to first get all classes accepting `UpdateCriteria` and modifying it successfully, before requiring its usage, and using the `SessionStore` instead of the sessions held only in memory of `sessiond`
    
    ## Changes
    - `SessionState` now accepts `SessionStateUpdateCriteria` argument optionally for all methods which modify state
    - Changes to `test_session_state.cpp` so that all test cases check that `SessionStateUpdateCriteria` is modified correctly

    Adding CLI for ICMP CPE monitoring (#1321)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1321
    
    This diffs adds a simple CLI to test ICMP pinging for CPE monitoring. The loop works like following:
    
    - Send gRPC call to mobilityd to get all connected valid subscribers, get SID and IP address of each subscriber.
    - Send ICMP ping to each subscriber, get average response time (latency in ms), attach timestamp.
    - Log subscriber IP address, SID and its latency response
    
    This loop will be translated into a new magma service, exposing a gRPC handler to expose status to cloud.

    1. The middleware has race condition that causes first two requests of users to fail if they are sent in the same time: both of them tries to create the user ent and one fails
    2. I believe it also slows down the requests. I am not sure about it. Anyway I will either add some caching before return or at least add some track time with jagger

    Update directoryd service iface in preparation for session ID indexer.
    
    Summary:
    ## Tl;dr
    We desire a non-hacky way to translate session IDs to IMSIs at the controller. This diff exposes session ID and IMSI getters/setters via the directoryd service.
    
    ## Context
    The FeG sends abort-session requests to the controller, which need to get translated to an IMSI. We don't have a good way of doing this right now, so the FeG sends the session ID as a concatenation of the IMSI and session ID.
    
    Instead, we want to utilize our new StateIndexer interface and plugin element to generate this mapping asynchronously.
    
    The StateIndexer type is intended to be run in a goroutine from the state service on new state updates (next diff).
    
    ## Changes to directoryd
    To support routing all reads/writes of derived state through the directoryd service [0], we add getters/setters for the following derived-state mappings
    - `{hwid -> hostname}`
    - `{session ID -> IMSI}`
    
    To logically collect location record manipulation, we move the getters for the following primary-state mappings just to the client API
    - `{imsi -> session ID}`
    - `{imsi -> hwid}`
    
    ## Changes to SyncRPC
    This last `{imsi -> hwid}` mapping is used by SyncRPC, so we move the functionality back to directoryd.
    
    ## FeG use-case overview
    
    {F230034335}
    
    ## Footnotes
    [0] Rather than having to reconcile the indexer and servicer views of directoryd's storage

    Adding support for netmask in ipv4 address.
    
    Summary: The current code accepts full IP flow match with mask 255.255.255.255. PCRF allows IPv4 addresses passed with bitmask length and FEG forwards these strings as is. This commit separates an address (provided in a dedicated bearer request) such as 194.128.20.42/24 into address part 194.128.20.42 and mask 255.255.255.0 by properly parsing the string according to TFT field format and filling up the corresponding TFT fields.

    Overwrite APN on Gy on ccr messages sent by FEG (#2001)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/2001
    
    For CWAG we may need to report all the wireless AP behind one single FEG with the same APN.
    
    This diff creates a feature to set an APN string which will overwrite the AVP field Called-Station-ID. This AVP will be sent on a CCR through Gy to the OCS
    
    The this feature can be enabled through a VarEnv on the FEG (OCSApnOverwriteFlag and OCSApnOverwriteEnv) or through API field "OverwriteAPN" under Gx configuration (by default set to "")
    
    This diff does not include neither Gx support nor configuration through NMS. Those will be done on different diffs.

    Add Search method to blobstore interface and implement on in-memory impl
    
    Summary:
    - For CPE monitoring, we need a way to search for specific state blobs by type and key. For example: return all state blobs of type ICMP status or SNMP status for subscribers s1, s2, s3 in network n1
    - Hook onto the existing SearchFilter type in blobstore for this - add type and key filter fields to the struct
    - Filter semantics are an AND of the 3 fields; type and key filters are OR's of the sets
    - Implement this new method on the in-memory blobstore and add integration test cases to cover

    Following advice from the person who created the Event form for WWW.
    He implemented the Event creation and edit on Comet (the new FB implementation).
    
    My question to him was regarding relay and forms: see post https://fb.workplace.com/groups/relay.support/permalink/2993406220707973/.
    
    He basically suggested to fetch the entire data on the root form component and ditch using fragments, as they are only good for displaying data, not mutating it.

    - Use keyword for all arguments just in case we need to do something like tagging/streaming using session id (<IMSI>-<int>)

    Update Datasource if parameters change
    
    Summary: If the api host for orc8r changes (e.g. you switch your deployment from local to prod while using the same user-grafana container) then the datasource will be querying the wrong api. This checks that the url is in sync every time and udpates the datasource if necessary.

    Summary:
    Add endpoints to the tenant metrics which mirrors the official prometheus `api/v1` paths. These will be used by the grafana prometheus datasource so we don't have to roll our own.
    
    Not every endpoint is implemented, but they can be added as required.

    Add Network Wide Policy Configurations to NMS (#1291)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1291
    
    We support the following endpoints in the Orc8r API
    ```GET /cwf/{network_id}/subscriber_config/rule_names (List the rule names (IDs) of all network wide rules in the network)
    POST /cwf/{network_id/subscriber_config/rules_names/{rule_id}(Adds the rule_id to the network config)
    DELETE /cwf/{network_id}/subscriber_config/rule_names/{rule_id} (Removes the rule_id from the network config)
    ```
    
    (We have the same set of endpoints for /feg/, /feg_lte/, /lte/ .)
    
    In NMS's Policies configuration page, I'd like to add a boolean field to the rule configuration, to indicate whether the rule is network wide or not.
    
    When the policy edit page is loaded, the NMS should query the GET endpoint and search through the list of rule IDs to see if the rule's id is in there. If it is, the field should be displayed as true.
    
    If the user changes the configuration, the POST and DELETE endpoints can be used to propagate the change.

    Improve Grafana error messaging
    
    Summary:
    Since there are quite a few places that the Grafana sync could fail, it's important to have detailed logs of what happened and what went wrong so network admins can debug the error.
    
    This diff adds the logging and an error display for the user when an error occurs. Additionally, it makes the sync job more robust and correct by not making any assumptions about the state of Grafana. E.g. Even if a user exists, it will still check that the user exists in the correct organization and fixes it if they don't.
    
    I would like to make a real react component for this, but the way the App is built right now makes that pretty difficult. Rendering on the server is a good stopgap for now.

    Handler to create Grafana datasources
    
    Summary:
    When an organization is added to Grafana, it needs to be prepopulated with a Data Source that knows how to query the Orc8r API for metrics.
    * This data source plugin was introduced in D19736432.
    * The datasource is configured when an organization is created or when an organization exists but does not have an orc8r datasource.
    * It is configured with the admin certs since these are required to query the API.
      * The data source itself is never viewable to the user, and even if it were the cert/key are obscured to be inaccessible.

    Get userID from NMS request and pass that as the authenticated user to Grafana via request header
    
    * If this user/org already exists in Grafana, the user will be "logged in" under that organization
    * If the user/org does not yet exist we have to create them in Grafana

      * User will be added to their organization as an `Editor`, meaning they can view and edit dashboards, but they cannot make any actions about datasources
    
    Notes:
    * Users can be in different organizations, but only logged in to one at a time
      * These users have different IDs, so it works as expected in Grafana
    * Username for Grafana is `NMSUser_<ID>` to avoid overlap with any users created inside Grafana itself

    Session recycling for WiFi should update the config (#1284)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1284
    
    When a WIFI session creation requested AND the IMSI already has a session, we recycle the existing session. We should override the existing session config with the new config.
    Ex. If the user switches AP, that will trigger a new CreateSession and our current implementation will recycle the old session. But since the old config still points to the previous AP, when the old AP gets around to sending a Terminate Request, the session incorrectly gets terminated.
    
    This should fix that problem, as `terminate_subscriber` in local enforcer only terminates the subscriber that matches the given APN and IMSI.

    Summary:
    Relay recently exposed the flow types for their code.
    The version isn't officially released yet but we can use it by installing the master version.
    
    I added $FlowFixMe to every error that was exposed due to this.
    New code will benefit from this and we can slowly go over these $FlowFixMe, fix them, and remove the comment.

    Fix broken dependency and upgrade python setuptools
    
    Summary:
    2 things here that caused our builds to fail:
    1. We needed to bump dateutils to 2.8.1 (required by another dep)
    2. There is a new way to retrieve the version when building a python package https://github.com/dateutil/dateutil/blob/master/setup.py#L50 that is only supported with a recent version of python-setuptools. Which was causing to build dependencies without version number. (dateutils_0.0.0.deb)
    
    Fix :
    1. bump dateutils
    2. Change provision script to get right setuptools version

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/1983
    
    - All the tags in ES are of the form "eventd" due to fluent-bit tagging them
            - Unfortunately fluent-bit uses the "tag" field in the json abjects that it forwards, so we use the name event_tag instead
    - All the hardware IDs in ES use the key "hw_id", not "hardware_id"
    - ES doesn't match `hw_id` as a term, so the `keyword` type must be used to prevent matching with individual tokens (hyhen is a valid separator to ES)

    Nuke stale pipelined check_quota arp entries
    
    Summary:
    on restarts we don't want to have any arp entries already set for the fake check quota IPs.
    
    Unfortunately we can't use this from inside docker so we can't remove arp with `arp -d`. Hopefully subnet of /16 is enough + arp timeout.
    
    I'll look into fixing the behavior with the wrong arp in the near future.

    Fix sporadic cwag integ_test failure caused by stale known_hosts keys.
    
    Summary:
    Our CWF fab setup eventually breaks if we *manually* ssh into a VM (assuming that VM uses Vagrant-managed custom keypairs).
    
    ## Tl;dr
    Our fab tests made use of the `known_hosts` file when it shouldn't have, so if we manually polluted that file then eventually fab will throw an error trying to ssh.
    
    ## First experienced
    - Running `fab integ_test` from `magma/cwf/gateway`
    - Error experienced
    
    ```
    Fatal error: Host key for 127.0.0.1 did not match pre-existing key! Server's key was changed recently, or possible man-in-the-middle attack.
    
    Underlying exception:
        Host key for server '127.0.0.1' does not match: got 'AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBIxmhXzpHNZPXdtswS5NNBDYDhTMLTS6BQ4D2uef9YcC8osl7ofwjSOkfonPJz2jWRqH9bKJYzR7fV69rR0FlGA=', expected 'AAAAE2VjZHNhLXNoYTItbmlzdHAyNTYAAAAIbmlzdHAyNTYAAABBBFF06VPKVRVIC+EgtcxYXNYD3Omi+GrBD8NjUw74VK2y3pMxM1MRPdRP9okZ0umaUrduavnBpnfO/cP7FtiNy54='
    ```
    
    ## Reproduce
    - `cd $MAGMA_ROOT/cwf/gateway`
    - `vagrant up cwag_test`
    - `ssh vagrant@127.0.0.1 -p 2222 -i $MAGMA_ROOT/cwf/gateway/.vagrant/machines/cwag_test/virtualbox/private_key` -- the cwag_test public key should now be in added to user's known_hosts
    - Nuke and restart cwag_test -- this installs a new keypair for cwag_test
    - `fab integ_test` now fails -- it consumes the stale public key from known_hosts, breaking ssh into cwag_test
    
    ## Resolution
    - Ad hoc: `> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` clear user's known hosts file
    - [this diff] General fix for CWF integ tests: disable `StrictHostKeyChecking` for local VMs
    
    ## Context
    - Our Vagrant VMs use [`ssh.insert_key = true`](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/vagrantfile/ssh_settings.html#config-ssh-insert_key) to insert per-VM ssh keypairs during VM creation phase
    - Vagrant automatically disables `StrictHostKeyChecking` since it expects the VM to be destroyed with non-trivial frequency (verify via `vagrant ssh-config`)
    - Vagrant also disables updating the user's known_hosts (`UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null`), preventing generating stale known_hosts entries
    - Our CWF `fab integ_test` didn't disable `StrictHostKeyChecking` for local VMs, so it failed when a VM was reloaded but a stale public key was left in `~/.ssh/known_hosts`

    Setting correct fileType for SiteSurveys images (#308)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/308
    
    **Problems**
    - Images where give the FileType = FILE since we were incorrectly checking for mimeTypes in the fileType field.
    - We were calling `questionFormat.toString()` on a nil `questionFormat`
    - We assume that because the `questionFormat` is `PHOTO` there's `photoData` available
    - We don't pass the image mimeType down to the server
    
    **Solutions**
    - Set FileType = IMAGE when adding an Image
    - Check if `questionFormat != nil` before accessing this field
    - Check if `photoData != nil` before accessing this field
    - Hard-code the `contentType` until we find a way to pass it down to the server
    
    **Note**
    - Set the contentType to `"image/jpeg"` for now. I'll implement this correctly in a future Diff

    Change default value for extra_quota_margin to 1024 (#1253)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1253
    
    There's a sessiond config called `extra_quota_margin` that affects when session's get terminated.
    The basic idea is that even if we've used up the charging quota and it is not the final grant, if it's excessively above the quota limit, we will terminate the service.
    This was added to tackle the case where the UpdateRequest to the reporter (FeG, or PolicyDB) failed. If the GRPC call fails permanently, we would eventually want to terminate the service.
    
    The issue here was the default value in the sessiond config was set to 0. Which meant that if pipelined reports > 100% of the charging quota grant, we would always terminate the session.
    
    I'm not sure if I like this solution because you can always find a data rate at which the session will always get terminated even if there's no failure. Maybe we can keep track of the number of failed grpc calls and terminate at a threshold.
    
    But in the meantime, I'll change the sessiond logic to take the max of (config value, default=1024bytes).

    Refactor graphql client to be platform-agnostic and move specific product logic to InventoryClient
    
    Summary:
    I organized cli so it now has 3 major libraries:
    1. **graphql_compiler** - Used to compile graphql queries of the product package to type-safe classes.
    2. **gql** - contains the graphql_client and responsible for the internals of working against a graphql server. Every product package should be linked against this package.
    3. **pyinventory** - Inventory Client with all product logic. builds with **graphql_compiler** and linked against **gql**
    
    If any other team would want, they can now use graphql very easily with the first two libraries

    On PGW handling of NW initiated activate / deactivate bearer requests, with updates of usages of SPGW IMSI => Tunnel ID map,
    as there can be multiple entries with the same IMSI for multiple PDN connections,
    the retrieval of SPGW UE context info state by IMSI is not sufficient as it will always return the last inserted entry,
    which causes a bug. This diff fixes it.
    
    - On `pgw_handle_nw_initiated_bearer_deactv_req`, it now traverses entire map to match by IMSI + EPS Bearer LBI.

    symphony/graph: implement workOrder{Added,Done} subscriptions
    
    Summary:
    - eventResolver intercepts AddWorkOrder / EditWorkOrder mutations and emits events if no error occured.
    - events pass through a pubsub as we have multiple instances of graph.
    - each connecting client creates a subscription / go channel and spawns a goroutine piping data between the two.

    The "count" value depends on resource attributes that cannot be determined
    until apply, so Terraform cannot predict how many instances will be created.
    To work around this, use the -target argument to first apply only the
    resources that the count depends on.

    Fix pipelined breakage caused by D19963620.
    
    Summary:
    Aside from fixing this breakage, this diff supports the debugging efforts in S196011.
    
    Pipelined no longer expected a metering-related element in its mconfig as of D19963620, but orc8r was still sending them, causing pipelined to fail. This diff provides backward compatibility by gracefully ignoring and logging spurious `network_services` received at the gateway.

    Fix Check quota routing (#1222)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1222
    
    Create a fake ip for each new UE to redirect traffic to the check quota server. This allows the traffic to be in the same subnet, therefore the check quota server will arp the bridge, and we'll respond to that.

    Terminate session on monitoring quota exhaustion on RAR/CCA-U (#1221)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1221
    
    # Connection Steering Feature Summary
    CWAG will host a flask server to indicate whether the subscriber has quota or not.
    
    If a subscriber tries to connect without any quota, the subscriber will stay connected for 30 seconds (configurable) but without any access to data. During this time, curling the flask server  should indicate that the subscriber is out of quota.
    Once the 30 seconds passes, the subscriber will get disconnected.
    
    If a subscriber runs out of quota mid-session, the subscriber will be disconnected immediately.
    
    # Implementation Details
    Currently, the way we configure policies for the CWF case is that only WLAN rules are monitored and tracked by the PCRF. This means that whenever a CWF session no longer has monitoring rules, the subscriber is out of quota.
    
    # What's changed in this diff
    This diff implements the case where a subscriber runs out of quota mid-session. In this case, sessiond will receive a CCA-Update or a RAR with rule removals for the monitored rules. In this case we terminate the session.

    symphony/front: websocket proxy to graph (#323)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/323
    
    Adding websocket proxy support required by graphql subscriptions.
    
    Changes include the following:
    1. replaced 'express-http-proxy' with 'http-proxy-middleware' as the former doesn't support websockets.
    2. on connection upgrade request the proxy doesn't invoke any middlewares (i.e. no auth) so added a new front endpoint (/user/me) to fetch current user.
    3. added WebSocketUpgradeHandler which authenticates the incoming upgrade request by calling /user/me.

    Migrate directoryd's hwid_to_hostname to blobstore
    
    Summary:
    ## Migration required
    - `/var/opt/magma/bin/m009_directoryd_to_blobstore` hwid_to_hostname to blobstore D19824772
    - The migration is mostly unimportant--just dropping a table of ephemeral data
    
    ## Diff contents
    Updates
    - Start using `hwid_to_hostname` via blobstore--no data migration required
    - Remove directoryd servicer--keeping service intact
    
    The directoryd servicer was acting as the wrapper around two disjoint data--`hwid_to_hostname` and `imsi_to_hwid`
    - `hwid_to_hostname` is now exposed via a `DirectorydStorage` interface, and consumed at syncrpc directly
    - `imsi_to_hwid` usages skip directoryd and interface with the state service directly

    Remove unused subscriberdb datastore usage, with resulting service updates.
    
    Summary:
    This will close T61119263. Subscriber state in the cloud used to be stored via datastore, accessed by the subscriberdb service. Subscriber state has since been moved to configurator, so the `SubscriberDBStorage` storage layer, which uses datastore, is no longer needed. We remove this as dead code.
    
    As a result of removing this storage layer, two orc8r services need to be updated. Subscriberdb and eps_authentication both used the old subscriberdb storage layer.
    
    - `subscriberdb`: service is updated to remove the subscriber-based servicer, leaving the policy-based servicers intact (the relevant REST handlers have previously been pointed toward configurator).
    - `eps_authentication`: after chatting with a few people, it looks like eps_auth is currently unused but its future is unclear. In any case, it is currently non-functional, so we remove its usage of the subscriberdb storage layer, add a non-functional replacement, and document its deprecation and unclear future.

    Alarms: Rearrange file structure
    
    Summary:
    The folder structure got a bit unruly.
    
    * The prometheus folder is now mostly prometheus parser related things(may move prometheus rules into there)
    * Created an alertmanager folder for everything alertmanager related. Firing alerts, receivers, routes
    * Created severity and table folders instead of using common for those
    * Extracted the colors from severity indicator into Severity.js

    Send eventd events to FluentBit via local TCP (#1200)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1200
    
    - This takes the Event received by LogEvent and sends it as a JSON string to FluentBit
    - Encoding:
            - Event.value is of type `bytes`, so `pickle` is used when making the RPC call
            - UTF-8 encoding is used for sending the message over TCP
            - Hexadecimal encoding is used for serializing the event bytes to a string
    - orc8r/gateway/config .yml file removed for clear source of truth for config

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1167
    
    - When we receive an Inform from a radio while its corresponding state machine is in the fault state, we should tentatively consider that the radio is ready for configuration again
    - Transition to the WaitInform state from ErrorState when we read an Inform
    - Refactor the ACS state interface adding a message parameter to `get_msg` so states know what message was last processed by `read_msg`; this allows us to implement this autoremediation without adding an additional transient state to each SM

    Add get_number_of_monitoring_rules to RuleStore
    
    Summary:
    ## Monitoring Quota Exhaustion Detection for CWF use case
    When Quota exhaustion is detected in the PCRF, it will send rule removals for the existing rules. This means that the session is out of monitoring quota once there are no rules installed tied to a monitor.
    This diff exposes a function `get_number_of_monitoring_rules` to sessiond's `RuleStore`. This way, at the end of each UpdateSession or ReAuthRequest, we can check if there are any existing monitoring rules in the system tied to the session.
    Once there is none, we can propagate that information to pipelined.
    
    This also includes a very minor refactoring in the session state test.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1194
    
    ## Monitoring Quota Exhaustion setup for Session Init/Terminate
    - When a session is started, we will propagate to pipelined that the subscriber has valid quota. (`SubscriberQuotaUpdate_Type_VALID_QUOTA`) (There's an edge case here where a session could be started with no monitoring quota, in which case I think the session is started without any rule installs/0 GSUs. I have to double check on exactly what this might look like. I will handle this in a later diff. )
    - When a session termination is started, we will propagate to pipelined that the subscriber is terminated. (`SubscriberQuotaUpdate_Type_TERMINATE`)
    
    ## Next Step
    - For each SessionUpdate response and RAR, we should check if there are any existing monitoring rules installed in the session. If there isn't any, we should mark the subscriber as out of quota. (`SubscriberQuotaUpdate_Type_NO_QUOTA`)
    - For session init, check for edge case where session create succeeds for users with out of quota

    Add events-based MemorySessionStore for handling session data access
    
    Summary:
    To enable stateless sessiond, a storage interface is required to have session states read and written on a per-transaction basis. As a first step towards this, the `SessionStore` class is being added to get the data for a session, make arbitrary writes on it, and then commit it to storage. `MemorySessionStore` is used to work out the interface here, though `RedisSessionStore` will be written to handle proper persistence.
    
    Here, since gRPC calls are handled concurrently by sessiond, there is a need to allow only one call to have R/W access on a subscriber at a time, and the SessionStore handles these details.
    
     ---
    
    ## Changes
    - Addition of `MemorySessionStore` to handle R/W of sessiond state, a non-persistent version of `SessionStore` which will be used to ensure that the interface works well for `session_manager`
    - Added unit tests to verify that `MemorySessionStore` works as intended

    movethingspatrick
    
    **For Stateless sessiond**
    
    The idea here is to just help get sessiond state stored in Redis for persistence, instead of always being held in memory.
    
    To do that, each class from `SessionState` and below need to be able to be marshaled/unmarshaled between a format appropriate for storage, either as serialized protobufs or serialized swagger models. As an intermediate step to this, each class will be responsible for a marshal/unmarshal method to change back and forth between data-only structs. From there, the storage interface, `SessionStore` will be responsible for getting the struct into storage.

    Magma-Grafana datasource
    
    Summary:
    This custom grafana datasource allows us to query metrics per tenant through grafana.
    * The datasource requires a url of the form: `https://<proxy-host>:9443/magma/v1/tenants/<tenant_id>`
    * Admin cert and key must be provided to the datasource
    
    Most of this code is copypasta from https://github.com/grafana/simple-json-datasource/blob/master/src/datasource.js, an official Grafana example datasource that they recommend modeling off of.

    * A matcher with a single value with be built as {label="value"}
    * A matcher with multiple values will be built as a regex matcher of an OR of the values: {label=~"value1|value2|value3"}
      * This is the only way a multiple value matcher can make sense, as it's impossible to EQUAL match multiple values.

    Adds concept of tenant (only exists in NMS as of now) which stores the list of `networkID`s accessbile by this tenant. Will be used by Grafana to allow data source to access all metrics owned by an tenant, rather than just a single network.
    
    * Tenants are keyed with an integer and include a name and list of network IDs
    * Endpoints are only accessible by a user with admin access
      * `/v1/tenants`
        * `GET`: retrieve all organizations
        * `POST`: create organization
      * `/v1/tenants/{org_id}`
        * `GET`: provided ID retrieve the name and list of networks
        * `PUT`: provide ID in path and put name and list of networks

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1164
    
    Making a helper function `handle_session_init_rule_updates` to move all of rule install/removal related logic into this one. Motivation is to make `init_session_credit` a bit easier on the eyes.
    
    Move the logic of `get_rules_from_policy_reauth_request` into the parent function. Since the function doesn't do much, it's probably better to keep it in the parent function so that the logic is not as fragmented.

    Using IMSI from ITTI for SGW/PGW messages (#1137)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1137
    
    - Setting and retrieving IMSI on msg header from MME, pcef_handlers to be used by SGW/PGW itti messages
    - Adding get_associated_imsi on SGW and PGW task to retrieve IMSI, adding debug messages to log retrieved IMSI
    
    This will enable SGW and PGW tasks with a defined method to retrieve the IMSI, this will be used to retrieve only specific state per UE from redis, so the entire state shouldn't be retrieved and parsed, just for the UE that the messages are processing. Also this will help for a cleaner way to add IMSI prefix to all logging messages.

    - Added useEffect to powerSearchBar, in order to set the filterValues on every change (they tend to come asynchronously, since they rely on data from server [location types, properties..)
    - Added useEffect to locationFilter component to retrieve the location names from server and fill the tokens (url contains ID)

    symphony/exporter/links: fix bug that that caused erros/panic (#260)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/260
    
    when on the for loop for each csv line - I collected the errors to verify the file structure is valid.
    On each error I used "continue" in order to skip to the next line.
    
    I had a nested for (for the ports) and i used continue in it as well - which didn't exit the row-run.
    
    Change - change it from continue to break and added a flag to verify the loop ended successfully.

    symphony/graphql: adding field collection support (#250)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/250
    
    Implementing collection.tmpl which adds `WithEdges(name1, name2, ...)` method to ent query builders which in turn invokes ent [eager loading](https://entgo.io/docs/eager-load/) API.  Names are expected to be mapped to graphql fields via `gqlgen` struct tag.
    In addition node.tmpl / pagination.tmpl were modified to automatically invoke the above API.
    
    See https://gqlgen.com/reference/field-collection/ for more info.

    ## What's Changed
    - sessiond now stores `monitoring_dest_host` and `charging_dest_host` as part of session state.
    - the destination hosts (for both gx and gy) received from CreateSession is used for the following Update and Terminate session requests.
    - with every credit update or monitoring update, we update the corresponding host in the message
    - With every update/termination request, we send up both the gy and gx hosts as part of the request.

    Clean up route handling in alertmanager configurer (#1132)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1132
    
    Turns out that there was no need to use both alertmanager's struct and the `RouteJSONWrapper`. Just copy and modify `Route` from alertmanager and use that everywhere to enable marshaling.

    Add http_config support to alertmanager configurer (#1130)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1130
    
    Adds `http_config` support to alertmanger configurer. This struct is used both globally for alertmanager and in some receiver configs.
    http_config is how alertmanager is configured to speak to http services. This includes basic auth, proxy_url, etc. This applies to the global alertmanager configuration, as well as a few receiver types.
    * Due to the way prometheus coded their structs, I had to copy some of them and make small modifications to enable JSON marshaling to work
    * Had to rearrange some directories to avoid import cycles
    
    There's no need for this functionality in orc8r so I didn't update the API to support it.

    Add basic error handling for CCA-Update permanent failure (#1134)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1134
    
    This diff adds some error handling for CCA-Updates for permanent diameter error codes.  (between 5000 & 6000).
    For usage monitor updates and charging credit updates, if we receive a permanent error, we should terminate that service. Since SessionProxy sends each monitoring update and charging update as separate requests, this is error handling on a command level.
    (It's not great that we are leaking session proxy logic into sessiond, but that has to be tackled with a much larger refactor)

    - There already exists a SqliteStore that can do this, but it treats the database as an in-memory one.
    - The file is stored in /var/opt/magma, together with redis_dump.rdb

    AlarmsContext
    
    Summary:
    The alarms feature is generic, and needs to be used by multiple teams with varying use cases. The Terragraph team needs to integrate event based alarms as well as metric based alarms. To enable customization of functionality per-project, the Alarms feature accepts certain interfaces as props. The project hosting the alarms component then passes props to customize alarms for its use case and the Alarms feature merely works with this props interface, unconcerned with the implementation details.
    
    This diff moves these props into a context. No more passing props through multiple levels and changing tests/flow types for all the levels in between. Project code doesn't need to change, the details of the context are handled internally.
    
    Another thing I'd like the context to do is some caching of things like routes and receivers since those are used on multiple pages.

    Better keycloak access token validation
    
    Summary:
    * verifies access token signature offline instead of making request to keycloak
    * unifies the different auth schemes
    * flow types openid-client and node-jose packages instead of using the oidcTypes file
    
    **How does offline signature verification work?**
    NMS has the realm public key from issuer discovery. This code checks for an `Authorization` header, if it's present, the bearer token is validated offline using node-jose's JSON Web Signature (JWS), the "user" is then extracted from the token and trusted for authorization checks.

    Some people are having issues with the login notice popping up in workorders even when they were logged in. Not sure why they're requesting routes they don't have permission for (could be a cookie issue?), but I took a look at the code again and it looks like I didn't actually check to see if the user was logged out before returning the 403 error.  This should fix the notice popping up when they're logged in.

    Dedicated bearer context creation change (#909)
    
    Summary:
    When a dedicated bearer activation message is received from PCRF, SPGW does not create a bearer context entry immediately as bearer id will be assigned by MME APP. So the parameters related to dedicated bearer such as DL TFT, QoS received from PCRF are sent to NAS in dedicated bearer activation request ITTI message and received back in dedicated bearer activation response. After receiving a successful response SPGW creates a new bearer context entry and stores the DL TFT and QoS parameters received in the response.
     This PR has changes to avoid unnecessary sending of bearer related parameters to NAS. A temporary bearer context entry is created when a dedicated bearer activation message is received from PCRF and the required values are stored. After receiving a successful response from UE, SPGW creates a new bearer context entry and copies the stored parameters from the temporary entry and deletes the temporary entry.

    To deal with a one-time data migration for the managed alertmanager configuration file, run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.metrics.yml exec alertmanager-configurer migration -alertmanager-conf=/etc/configs/alertmanager.yml` if running on Docker, or `kubectl exec -it -n magma <alertmanager-configurer-instance> -- migration -alertmanager-conf=/etc/configs/alertmanager.yml` if running on kubernetes.
    
    Refactor alertmanager-configurer to more naturally support single-tenant usage. Also remove all references to 'network' in favor of 'tenant'

    Pull prometheus query restrictor out of Obsidian (#1096)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1096
    
    As part of the decoupling of metrics components from magma it makes sense to move the query restrictor to it's own directory under prometheus since it's used throughout many prometheus components

At the time of dedicated bearer creation, with this diff, we can assign a higher priority for the flow rules programmed for the dedicated bearer.

    *Upgrade Required*
    Change the `alertmanagerApiUrl` field in `metricsd.yml` from `<alertmanager-host>/api/v2/alerts` to `<alertmanager-host>/api/v2`
    * Add API endpoints to set/get/delete alert silencers in prometheus alertmanager
    * Silencers have a set of matchers (labels) and start/end times. During that time, any alert which matches those labels will have a status="silenced" and will not be sent to any receivers.
    * This is useful if you have noisy alerts but have already acknowledged them, or if you want to pre-emptively silence some alerts because you are about to perform some sort of maintenance

    Summary:
    To allow usage of local policy/basename assignment control from the AGW, this workaround allows the `policydb_cli.py` to enable/disable static rules without needing the session_id.
    
    ## Changes
    - When `PolicyReAuthRequest` is received by `sessiond` `SessionProxyResponder`, if an empty `session_id` is specified, then rule changes will apply to all active sessions

    - `captive_portal_cli.py` merged into `policydb_cli.py`
    
    - `policydb_cli.py` now makes calls to the `PolicyDBService` running on `policydb` for control of enabling/disabling static rules from gateway side
    
     ---
    
    ## Usage
    
    To effectively use the captive portal feature, network operators should write their own service to run on the gateway. This service should keep track of when to disable the captive portal for users, and when to re-enable it. Calling the CLI would allow the service to do this.

    Summary:
    ## Changes
    - RuleMappingsStreamerCallback will now take updates and send a RAR to sessiond to both install and uninstall rules as configuration is changed in orchestrator. The callback will also update RuleAssignmentsDict
    
    NOTE: `policydb:installed` which is used for storing the active policy-rules/base-names for a subscriber will be wiped on restart of the `policydb` service. This wiping should be turned off after `sessiond` becomes stateless.

    Handling Terminate message in NAS and PGW tasks after state is destroyed
    
    Summary:
    When MME receives a SIGTERM signal, a terminate message is sent to all ITTI
    tasks. If NAS task tries to read the mme_nas_state after the MME task has
    terminated a segmentation fault is triggered.
    
    Similarly, if PGW task tries to read the spgw_state after the SGW task has already
    terminated, it fails the assert on non-null state. This change skips the
    spgw_state lookup when PGW task receives a Terminate message.

    - All errors are returned to the client, and only the first one is shown at the moment.
    
    Next step:
    - Client: show the client (nicely) "you have 4 lines with errors, these are the errors" with options of :
    a = Commit the rest (will send the server the same file with "skip_lines" array and verify_before_commit=false)
    b = abort process.

    Dockerize ue-simulator service
    
    Summary:
    This diff adds a dockerfile for the uesimulator service.
    This file will also work for any future golang services at
    `magma/cwf/gateway/...`. Having the ability to run the uesimulator
    service as a docker container will be useful for both the CWF
    integration test system (e.g. simulating 2 WACs) and FeG HA chaos
    testing.

    Summary:
    Had a bug where if you had a location filter in the equipment search, clicked next and then back, the wizard would crash.
    This happened because the filter config for the existing value wasn't present.
    
    Note: we probably need to refactor the search in overall, as it's pretty flakey and the flow types aren't the greatest.

    Look at `yarn.lock` to ensure that version of `serialize-javascript` is not vulnerable.
    Realize it still is.
    
    Merge a bunch of things manually that were split up. Mainly `terser-webpack-plugin@^1.2.3` with `terser-webpack-plugin@^1.2.4`, run `yarn install`.

    Description: MME was crashing when EEA1/2 ciphering algorithm was chosen while sending Detach Accept.
    Detach accept includes only 2 byte information, while performing EEA1/2 encryption, algorithm was trying to copy encrypted message of length multiples of 4.
    Since for 2 byte buffer, algorithm was trying to copy 4 byte that was leading to crash.
    Fix is provided such that buffer will be allocated in multiples of 4 byes based on message length.
    If message length is 2 bytes then memory is allocated 4 bytes.

    Use volume for mysql and wait for mysql to be ready in NMS docker-compose
    
    Summary:
    - Use a volume for mysql so that bringing the docker-compose down won't remove the users
    - Use wait-for-it.sh so magmalte doesn't try to start before mysql is ready. When this happens, the magmalte container needs to be restarted manually.

    Change HSS Lite to not to modify "read only" configs on Start (#1080)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1080
    
    Change HSS Lite to not to modify "read only" configs on Start
    HSS Lite needs to communicate back to the caller it's "real" local address when it's
    started without preconfigured port. This kind of (port-less) configuration is used by
    unit tests to avoid test failures due to port availability/conflicts.
    Currently HSS Lite modifies its own config during blocking Start() call which is not
    thread safe as well as non-obvious for the caller. This diff changes Start's completion
    chan to be used to communicate local address as well as start completion.

    We recently synchronized Magma's version of go-diameter with the github's version

    handling Typeahead popout scrolling
    
    Summary:
    Changing the popout position to "fixed" (for it to be shown outside of parent container), forces us to handle its actual position changing according to the input container position change.
    
    Current implementation - easier but performance costing - using setTimeout (trying to be as cost effective as possible, but still, consumes much cpu time).
    Possible alternative - much more complex and error prone - tracking possible parent container scrolling events.

    Force Sctpd service to restart whenever MME restarts
    
    Summary:
    Sctpd was recently separated into its own package out of Magma package. As part
    of these changes, sctpd systemd conf file was changed to ensure the service does
    not restart when other Magma services (in particular MME) restart during
    upgrade. This is desired behavior for stateless Magma Access Gateway. But until
    that feature is enabled, sctpd should restart whenever MME restarts. This change
    fixes that.

    Multi pdn fix for negative tcs (#1051)
    
    Summary:
    This PR contains fixes for the following issues:
    1. MME APP was comparing the bearer id value instead of esm_ctx.n_active_ebrs with BEARERS_PER_UE
    2. While handling PDN disconnect message PTI(Procedure Transaction Identity), which is a temporary parameter was used to fetch the PDN connection id instead of using the linked bearer id (LBI) received in the message
    3. If a wrong/invalid APN is received in the PDN connectivity request message MME was sending EMM status message. As per the spec PDN reject with cause "Missing/unknown APN" should be sent
    4. If PDN disconnect was received for the last PDN, MME was not sending PDN disconnect reject message
    
    Test Plan :
    1. Executed sanity
    2. Executed multi PDN TCs
    3. Executed dedicated bearer TCs

    update device page to use new state in API
    
    Summary:
    using the state within the devices API simplifies a bunch of unnecessary complexity (extracting device state from the agents state via merging data from two calls)
    
    This also fixes a bug where if you edit a device, the managing agent gets removed

    Add support for non-ASCII rules' monitoring keys (#1054)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1054
    
    Add support for non-ASCII rules' monitoring keys.
    Monitoring Keys are Octet strings and should be entered as such. We use base64 encoding for them (on swagger - REST API).
    Any valid base64 encoded MonitoringKey will be decoded before PolicyRule is streamed as proto message.
    If a MonitoringKey is NOT a valid base64 string, it'll be passed as is (string to []byte) to the streamer. So, monitoring key such as "cat" will be passed as is, but 'dGhpcyBpcyBhIHJ1bGU=' will be decoded.
    Therefore it's advisable to always base64 encode MonitoringKeys for static rules during creation.

    Add optimization to gateway GetUpdates logic allowing intelligent non-updates to mconfigs.
    
    Summary:
    GatewayConfigsMetadata now includes a GatewayConfigsDigest, storing the hash of a GatewayConfigs (hash taken with empty metadata field). The gateway passes this digest to GetUpdates via the extraArgs parameter. The cloud still generates the new GatewayConfigs for the requesting gateway, but compares its generated digest with the received digest; if the digests are equal, an empty UpdateBatch is returned to the gateway.
    
    Originally the plan was to generate the digest both at the cloud and gateway, without storing any new information in GatewayConfigsMetadata. However, canonical bytewise representation is a non-feature for protobufs, hindering this approach. Workarounds, such as a JSON-based canonical representation, were considered, but ultimately deemed undesirably hacky.
    
    Thus, since golang's protobuf implementation supports a deterministic bytewise encoding, the cloud generates the digest and passes it to the gateway via a new field in GatewayConfigsMetadata.

    1. There is a lot of copy-pasta code between the viewers. We should fix this later, but I want to unblock this fix for the demo.
    2. The map view is broken for me (even without my change), so I can't test this change.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1043
    
    This small refactor from having `reloadPrometheus` being a helper function in the handlers file to being a method of the PrometheusAlertClient makes the method calls cleaner since we can just pass the alertmanager URl to the client on construction. Also allows the return of `ReloadPrometheus` to be controlled and tested for in unit tests.

    Simplify report_termination calls (#1038)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1038
    
    `report_termination` currently takes in a callback function that gets called after the reporting grpc call is made. Since we don't do anything other than log the status of the call, I added a separate function that returns a callback fn that logs the result, to clean up the codebase a bit.
    
    Eventually, we should properly handle the error since there could be many reasons behind the error.

    Making ovs flows persists across MME restart
    
    Summary:
    The MME process always cleans up all the OVS when the switch connects to the
    controller. This change adds a check that flows are only removed when the
    `persist_state` flag is false. Instead of triggering the flow removal through
    BaseApplication, we can do it through the OpenflowController object itself.
    
    Also fixed some formatting.

    Its not pretty but it'll do for now. The downside to this reinsertion is that it might interrupt the tcp connection and we'll lost pkt count for that rule

    Add pipelined restart recovery logic
    
    Summary:
    This diff adds logic to prevent flow resets on pipelined resets.
    
    First verify that bridge won't nuke all flows if controller disconnects (`sudo ovs-vsctl set-fail-mode gtp_br0 secure`), should probably be included into `magma_pipelined.service` or into other startup file?
    
    Instead of nuking all flows with `_delete_all_flows` this will first get all active flows in its table(using the startup flows controller).
    
    Once it receives the flows it will(if flows are not ready we'll fail and sessiond will retry later) ->
     - verify that default flows are included
     - verify that additional user flows are included
     - remove all other flows that might not have been removed because pipelined wasn't active

    Replace existing value with QueryRestrictor instead of adding duplicate (#1019)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1019
    
    In the prometheus configmanager we found that networkID was being appended twice in the labels. This is because the QueryRestrictor didn't handle the case of the label already existing.
    
    Also refactor the test file for QueryRestrictor.

    Summary:
    ## Changes
    The policydb will now give an infinite, unmetered credit grant to subscribers that attach.
    
    The credit grant is specified by a configurable charging key in policydb.yml. This feature can be disabled.
    
    ## Direction
    As the local PCRF, policydb will offer local enforcement (without federation). This change paves the way for metered policies for post-pay charging models.

    10.10.2.1. Using the 10.10.2.* subnet for this interface as `eth0` gets assigned
    a 10.0.2.* IP from host-side Natting.

    Implement garbage collector for state service (#1004)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1004
    
    This diff implements garbage collection functionality for
    the state service. This will ensure that "deleted" state on the gateway
    is propagated back to the Orchestrator.
    
    The garbage collector works by iterating through all garbage keys
    of each configured redis dict, and then sending a single DeleteStates RPC
    call to the Orchestrator. If this call succeeds, the state is
    deleted locally from Redis.
    
    *One key note*: State replication and garbage collection do not run at the
    same time. Currently garbage collection is run after 5 iterations of replication.
    This is purposedly done to help avoid race conditions for State in the Orchestrator
    without having to lock every key for a long amount of time (read, RPC call and potential delete).
    
    To illustrate this, consider:
        t1 (replication): Load all keys (N is large) of non-garbage state
        t1 (replication): Read redis key v and add it to replication request
        t3 (application): Marks redis key v as garbage
        t2 (gc): Begin running iteration, loading all keys (N is small) of garbage state
        t2 (gc): Send DeleteStates RPC call
        t1 (replication): Finishes aggregating request, sending RPC call to replicate state for key v
    
    The result is state that shouldn't exist in the Orchestrator, without that state existing on the gateway.

    Add support for tombstoning objects in Redis (#1003)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/1003
    
    This diff adds the ability to mark an object as garbage
    is redis, without directly deleting the object itself. This functionality
    allows for a garbage collector to iterate over all garbage and delete those
    states from the Orchestrator.
    
    The implementation adds to the RedisState proto (redis object metadata)
    an `is_garbage` field. The RedisFlatDict is updated to treat garbage objects
    as deleted, such that clients see no functional difference between a deleted
    object and a garbage object.
    
    While using metadata stored with the object leads to a less efficient implementation,
    it is favored over an alternative implementation of deleting the object and storing a
    list of garbage type:keys as it allows us to still read the garbage collected data,
    which may be needed for global resource allocation.

    Add cleanup functionality to state service for keys that have been deleted
    
    Summary:
    This diff corrects a bug that currently exists in the state service where if a
    key gets deleted and then re-added to Redis, the addition may not be replicated to
    the state service if the key has the same version as it had before it was deleted.
    
    This diff fixes this issue by keeping track of which keys have been seen each iteration.
    After replicating state, the state replicator cleans up it's internal dict to only store
    this keys. Thus any deleted keys, will be removed from this internal dictionary.

    PromQL Parser
    
    Summary:
    Implements a parser for a strict subset of PromQL. This parser takes an input PromQL string and returns a javascript object that implements the `PromQL.Expression` interface.
    * The parser is generated using the nearley package, from the grammar defined in `PromQLGrammar.ne`
      * To generate the parser, run `nearleyc fbcnms-packages/fbcnms-alarms/components/prometheus/PromQLGrammer.ne -o fbcnms-packages/fbcnms-alarms/components/prometheus/__generated__/PromQLGrammar.js`. You need the nearley node package: `npm install -g nearley`
    * I have not implemented a few features of the language, e.g. the `by` clause of `sum(metric) by (label)`
      * I will add this in a stacked diff to show how to iterate on the parser by just modifying the grammar.
    
    Javascript Note: I have disabled eslint on the generated PromQLGrammar.js file since it generates it in a way that causes a bunch of lint errors. I believe the tests should be sufficient to feel confident that this works without issue.
    
    Note: I made a change to the tokenizer where I parse the `PromQL.Range` object in the tokenizer. This is the best solution to the problem of how to get the range values out of the string in my opinion. Since the tokenizer matches a regex, you can parse the string without having to worry about it being in a different format than you expect.

    PromQL Tokenizer
    
    Summary:
    Implements a tokenizer for a strict subset of the Prometheus Query Language using the 'moo' lexer library.
    * There isn't a descriptive grammar for PromQL that I can find anywhere so this is my best approximation of how the tokenizer should work.
    * This will be very easy to amend/add in the future if changes are necessary
    * moo integrates well with other parsing libraries so we should be able to feed the output of this lexer right into a parser.

    PromQL Generator
    
    Summary:
    Generalize the building of PromQL queries with this package. PromQL is built from only a few distinct components
    * Metric Selectors
    * Functions
    * Aggregations
    * Binary Operations
    
    These can be put together in various forms to build syntactically correct PromQL queries. This will enable quicker development for future metric dashboard and alert rule pages since we won't have to build a specific PromQL generator for each use case. Instead, just put the components together and call `toPromQL()`.
    
    See unit tests and ToggleableExpressionEditor for usage.

    Support reception of empty HTTP request after provisioning session end (#993)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/993
    
    After a TR-069 provisioning session, which is ended by `enodebd` sending an empty HTTP response, it is expected that the eNodeB will not send any TR-069 messages other than an `Inform` to start a new provisioning session. It is found that for at least one device/software combination, the eNodeB will send an empty HTTP request, which is unhandled and will cause `enodebd` to go into an error state.
    
    ## Changes
    Service `enodebd` will handle an empty HTTP request outside of a TR-069 provisioning session by ignoring it.

    Summary:
    2 bugs with setting device id that this diff addresses:
    1. Js error when typing in the inputs if there is no linked device.  This causes the whole component to crash.
    2. After setting the device id, if you click "edit" for the equipment again, the inputs for device and network id are empty, which is pretty confusing.  The expected behavior is that the id's persist.  Turns out we weren't setting the device id in the resolver.

    Summary:
    In the current setup of the integration test, we do the following:
    1. setup cwag test networking in the test VM
    2. start the services in the magma VM
    3. start the tests in the test VM
    
    Somehow, the route added in the first step would be removed when step 3 happens. I'm not 100% sure on the root cause but my hunch is that we run the ansible script when we try to ssh into the test VM again.
    
    I'll probably change the setup so that we don't rerun the ansible script again in the future

    Support dynamic services in magmad ServicePoller
    
    Summary:
    - When ServiceManager restarts a service, it first tells ServicePoller to process the restart
    - Since ServicePoller didn't support dynamic services, it would KeyError when told to restart a dynamic service (e.g. td-agent-bit)
    - This exception blocked ServiceManager from restarting services, so control_proxy would not restart to pick up refreshed bootstrap certs, meaning that all cloud requests would fail after the original certs expired.
    - I didn't test the td-agent-bit restart on bootstrap functionality after changing it from a regular service to a dynamic service, so this was uncovered in dogfooding.
    - Fix by making ServicePoller aware of dynamic services

    Event Alarms integration
    
    Summary:
    * Integrate terragraph's event alarms service
    * Create a generic framework for integrating different types of rules / rule sources
    
    * When creating a rule, a dropdown box is provided allowing the user to select a rule type. If only one rule type is specified (symphony) no dropdown is provided.
    * Once a rule is created, its type may not be changed.
    * Rules are loaded from both sources simultaneously. If one source fails to load, the other source is not held up and the table will still render.
    
    * introduces a new type called RuleInterface. Whenever a new rule type needs to be added, or a new feature is added which is different between rule types, properties can be added to the rule interface and implemented in the respective rule type interfaces.

    Add `use_local_session_proxy` to unbreak sessiond <-> session proxy connection in the CWAG integration test (#979)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/979
    
    The CWAG Integration test relies on talking to a locally running Session Proxy service to run the test. Originally, it used a flag in sessiond to specifiy a local port. But sessiond was modified in D18073209 to no longer use these flags. Leading to a http `502` error when sessiond tries to talk to sessionProxy.
    I'm putting back in a similar piece of code back into sessiond, but to avoid confusion I'm now calling this flag `use_local_session_proxy` and documented that it is used for testing.

    Refactor the way integ test config files are loaded into services (#976)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/976
    
    Some small integration test config related refactor.
    - redis.conf should be mounted on as part of the docker-compose. The current setup fails if we use the docker-compose.integ_test.yml without running the fab script. This is kind of a specific case, but now it's much cleaner.
    - sessiond.yml should be loaded into sessiond service the same way pipelined.yml is loaded into pipelined. This way we don't corrupt the override directory.

    CreditUpdateResponse proto support for infinite credit, monitored/unmonitored
    
    Summary:
    ## What's Changed
    Adding an enum field in CreditUpdateResponse to be able to specify whether a credit grant is finite/infinite, and whether is is monitored or unmonitored.
    
    ## Reason for Change
    Policies such as redirection when used for captive portal functionality should have an infinite credit grant rather than the current behavior of being enabled/disabled adhoc by the policydb service. The redirection flow installed here does not require monitoring either.
    
    Other policies installed in a post-pay charging model will have infinite credit grants, but require metering.

    Namely:
    > **Breaking: Defining prettier options must use an object**
    Drop support for specifying prettier options using the "fb" shorthand
    string. Replace "fb" with either config in your .prettierrc or the object:
    `{ singleQuote: true, trailingComma: 'all', bracketSpacing: false, jsxBracketSameLine: true, parser: 'flow'}`
    
    And
    > **Breaking: Remove pragma support**
    Prettier now provides native pragma support using Format or prettier
    notation. Use that instead of our implementation

    Fix async bugs in sessiond's RestartHandler (#968)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/968
    
    This diff re-enables sessiond's RestartHandler and
    fixes two bugs that were producing service crashes:
        1. The directoryd promise was being set multiple times, causing an exception
        2. The `terminate_subscriber_call` was being treated like a synchronous call
    
    This diff fixes these bugs by making better use of c++ async's functionality.
    Now, sessiond fetches all previous sessions, retrying if necessary, and then
    attempts to terminate each session.
    
    Note: This diff also contains changes produced from `clang-format`

    yarn update
    
    Summary:
    `yarn upgrade-interactive`
    `yarn install`
    
    this upgrades react-relay to 7.1.0.  However, 7.1.0 does not have relay hooks which several inventory components need.  To fix this, I followed https://relay.dev/docs/en/experimental/step-by-step#step-4-adding-relay-to-our-project and ran:
    
    `yarn workspace inventory add react-relay@experimental`
    `yarn install`
    
    The experimental react-relay includes relay hooks.
    
    One problem is, if I try running `yarn upgrade-interactive` after, then it doesn't correctly detect updates for react-relay experiemental, and will attempt to install version 0.0.0. For future upgrades we might need to omit react-relay.

    Currently, RestartHandler is causing sessiond and subsequent MME services
    to crash, due to 2 async bugs. This diff disables the restart handler so as to
    unbreak master. A proper fix will be stacked on top of this diff.

    Standalone PCRF installs static policy rules registered to subscribers
    
    Summary:
    Captive portal functionality is being made less of a special case from the rest of local PCRF/OCS.
    
    For all static policy rules assigned to users, including redirection for captive portal, it is suggested that network operators use the NMS to register the policies to the subscribers. From there, policydb will act as the local PCRF and get pipelined to install the rules for the subscriber.
    
    Captive portal will now be installed per user and configured the same as any other rule on the local PCRF/OCS

    * Note: There's something funky with material ui's autocomplete and we couldn't figure out how to get it to trigger onChange during every input so we have to do a hacky thing which gets rid of the actual "autocomplete" functionality. It's okay because we don't really need that.

    adding log when user tries to access route without permission
    
    Summary:
    Debug logs don't show up in kibana, so I'm changing it to "info" so we can figure out why everis/ipt is running into so many "you have been logged out" notices.
    
    looking at kibana 403 http requests help too but there are some weird inconsistencies like there are no 403's around Nov 21 when the problem was initially reported. Hoping this log can help give a better picture.

    This diff implements a thread to load all directory records
    in sessiond and sends CCR-Ts for each on sessiond start. This is a
    more graceful way to handle service restart and avoids relying
    on PCRF/OCS ASR to ensure subsequent sessions can be created
    after sessiond restart.

    GRPC uses the same wire format (see https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#backwards-compatibility)

    Get interface indices via snmpwalk (#927)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/927
    
    The getNumberOfInterfaces function returns the number of physical and virtual interfaces, wich messes with our logic of reading interface indices. This gets the interface indices by doing an snmpwalk over the mib which has those interfaces.
    
    This is slightly less efficient because walk happens in series instead of parallel, but the next diff in this stack will save the indices so that they're not read repeatedly retrieved, leading to an overall perf gain.

    gate "you have been logged out" notice with feature flag (#91)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/symphony/pull/91
    
    Implemented in D18689780 initially, then partially reverted with D18706834 because it broke the build. This is likely due to attempting to import a function from a server-side file (features.js in platform-server).  Work around is just declaring the function within ApplicationMain directly.

    Handle "IMSI" prepended labels
    
    Summary: The api endpoint for directory record wants "IMSI" to be prepended to the imsi number. The metrics generated for IMSIs sometimes include and sometimes don't include this. This handles them by always adding "IMSI" to the api request, and always displaying it in the graph selector without it.

    # What's Changed

    # Upcoming

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/935
    
    ## What's Changed
    *CreateSession calls to captive_portal's CentralSessionController no longer get a response with any allocated credits*
    - sessiond will then not track credit usage, but will still enable the redirect static rule
    - pipelined will still track credit usage, but its flow reporting to sessiond will never trigger the redirect rule to be deactivated
    
    ### Upcoming
    - Add in pipelined support for untracked policy rules. This is not necessary to get the captive portal actually working

    Update diameter services to maintain connections when active (#938)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/938
    
    When the health manager on the FeG sends ENABLE to diameter services,
    the current behavior is to ensure connection creation is enabled. However, a
    connection is not created if one does not exist. This means that after a
    failover, the Active FeG services won't have connection to core services.
    This causes errors on the core side. Additionally, messages that originate
    from the core (RTR, RAR, etc.) won't be handled properly until a connection
    is created from a AG -> FeG request. This diff fixes this by ensuring a connection
    exists (GetConnection) on each Enable call.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/928
    
    When we are using USE_GY_FOR_AUTH_ONLY, we do not care about any rating group that might be returned as part of gx CCA-I. We will always send a gy CCR-I with no MSCC specified. My previous impression was that we send a CCR-I to gy ~regardless~ of whether there is a rating group or not.
    To simplify the logic, I've created a separate function that deals with this specific case that CreateSession will call.

    Since we only need the `ChargingRuleNameSet` keyed by its name on the FeG side, I've modified the provider to send only the name set.

    Fix RTR and ASR relaying
    
    Summary:
    Currently RTR and ASR requests are timing out during the feg_relay. This
    is due to a mismatch in service name added to the request from Orc8r -> CWAG and
    the CWAG's service registry. This diff fixes that bug.

    Summary:
    - We need a way to make dependencies which come from repositories other than main debian upstream installable with the magma package
    - Add a "mirrored_packages" file to the release directory for any such dependencies (currently only fluent-bit)
    - `fab package` will now download any dependencies in this file via apt so they can be shipped up the the magma package repository with the magma package
    - Note that fluent-bit is a simple case of this as it only has a few dependencies, all of which are present in main debian

    Refactor table managment into physical and logical controllers (#896)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/896
    
    Split the dataplane into 2 components separated by the InMiddleOut(old InOut controller, we need a better name...) the physical plane is processing arp/acl/tunnel_learn, the logical is enforcing policies, dpi,, stats, etc. The new table InOut manages sits between the two. The passtrhough traffic(dhcp/dns) will skip the logical plane. All controllers have a new field apptype. Currently special controllers have a None type, might change that to a reserved value to make it less error prone.

    Pass DNS/DHCP traffic up until the enforcement controller
    
    Summary: Before DNS/DHCP traffic was tagged with passthrough and it would enter ingress and exit egress, which would fail due to tunnel learn not being applied. This allows passtrhoguh traffic(currently DNS/DHCP) to go into arpd, access_control, tunnel_learn controllers, and installs a rule into enforcement that send it directly out of egress instead of going through enforcement rules.

    longer snmp timeout
    
    Summary:
    Increase SNMP timeout to 50 seconds (instead of 5 seconds) and polling interval to 55 seconds instead of 10 seconds.
    
    I increased the SNMP timeout because we were seeing issues with ENS's core switches. They have lots of interfaces and as such the many snmp requests get slowed down a LOT. I created a task to batch our SNMP requests, which will hopefully quicken everything, and we can lower the timeout to a reasonable length.
    
    By making the polling interval 55s, since the UI updates every minute, we should still see an update.
    
    This slows the tests down a bit (the ones that wait for snmp timeouts). We'll address that when this is resolved.

    always show config when network configuration icon is clicked
    
    Summary:
    original behavior
    1) on map page, click on network configuration icon
    2) lands on network configuration page at url `networkId/configure/network` with configs shown
    3) click on network configuration icon again, url goes to `networkId/configure`, configs disappear. rage!
    4) Can restore by clicking the tab, which browses back to url `networkId/configure/network`, not bug but confusing.
    
    Now:
    1) on map page, click on network configuration icon
    2) lands on network configuration page at url `networkId/configure` with configs shown
    3) click on network configuration icon again, url stays on `networkId/configure`, and configs remain.
    4) clicking on the tab, configs remain.
    
    not really a bug, but it's really confusing

    - Note the SSL record above comes back immediately with type 0x15 (SSL3_RT_ALERT), which means that the server is unable to proceed with the handshake after the client's hello packet (the 200 bytes written). This is possibly related to https://github.com/fluent/fluentd/issues/2699
    - This is reproducible with both a chained cert file from digicert and just the leaf cert by itself. Specifying a `-servername` parameter for SNI doesn't solve anything in either case.
    - However, if we use an x.509 version 1 cert signed by a self-signed root CA, fluentd is able to negotiate the SSL/TLS handshake successfully
    - Since we aren't validating TLS in the fluent-bit config, the fact that the rootCA on the gateway won't validate the SSL cert provided by the server won't matter, so we can safely use the self-signed cert. We really just care that the traffic is TLS-encrypted and TLS mutual authentication happens using the controller's certifier CAcert.
    - So instead of re-using the controller.crt/controller.key legit SSL certs, use fluentd.pem/fluentd.key for the forwarder pod

    Summary:
    - Add throttle filter to fluent-bit configuration currently configured to allow a rough ceiling of 10GB/month of log data
    - At a rough estimate of 200 bytes per log line sent to fluentd, windowing at 1000 lines per minute average rate over 5 minutes gives us roughly 10GB/month of data usage if the log rate is pinned all the time.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/891
    
    - The number of bytes PCRF was returning at each CCA-U was much smaller than the traffic sent by the UE. This makes it harder to read the session_proxy logs when debugging. I'm increasing return bytes to make it so that ~2 CCR-Us are sent up to the PCRF which is more than enough to test the functionality.
    - I've also added some messages to assertions so that they give a little bit more insight into what is failing.

    Remove OCS send failure metric incremention on bad result-code
    
    Summary:
    Remove metric incrementation of transport level metrics for
    a bad result code. SendFailure metrics are used by the FeG's health service
    to determine transport level failure. This metric was causing failovers
    unecessarily.
    
    Longer term, we need FeG HA testing to ensure we don't regress scenarios like
    this. Additionally, I need to look at a better way of labeling, or detecting
    transport level failures to avoid situations like this.

    Some features we want to enable with this fix is:

    2. Even if no rating group / charging key is specified in the gx CCA-I, we still want to send a gy CCR-I and ensure that it sends back an answer successfully. Otherwise, we will not create a session.

    Only display graph legend with few enough labels
    
    Summary: If a graph had a bunch of metric series, the labels would squash the graph, making it unusable. I couldn't figure out how to make the legend a fixed size and scrollable, so this stopgap fix just removes the legend if it has more than 5 labels. In order to maintain usability I fixed the tooltip that displays when you hover over datapoints. It now shows the labels at that point. Additionally I made the hover hit size bigger so it's a lot easier to hit the point with your mouse.

    Update health configuration to favor network level configs (#881)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/881
    
    Recent testing has shown that having hierarchical configs for the health service
    is causing issues. The health service always reads network level configs, while mconfig
    uses gw configs if they're set (otherwise network configs).
    
    The true home for the health configs resides in between the network and the gateway
    at the cluster level. Until that concept is introduced though, we should use the network
    level. This diff implements that change by always streaming network level health configs
    if they're set. A subsequent diff can remove health configs from the gateway swagger
    struct altogether.

    Change enforcement_test to use static rules not dynamic (#877)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/877
    
    - Since most of the rules will be in forms of static policies, referenced by dynamic policies in PCRF, I'm modifying the enforcement test to use static rules.
    - I've written a very basic static rule to allow all traffic for now. But I will followup after this diff with the 3 static rules that we will be using with our partners.
    - I've refactored the test a bit to make a rule_manager struct that keeps track of all static/dynami rules and monitors.

    Make new policy handlers backwards-compatible
    
    Summary:
    - Since the NMS was updated to use the v1 policies API, the previous backwards-breaking changes to add subscriber mappings to base names and policies have to be made backwards-compatible with the old version of the API
    - Move the policy rule config from a nested object back to the top level of the policy rule
    - Put the full entity view list API endpoints behind a ?view=full query parameter and restore the ID-only list behavior of the regular endpoints

    Summary:
    1. This PR has the following fixes:
    a.      Send dedicated bearer activation reject to NW when an invalid IMSI or LBI is received
    b.      Send dedicated bearer deactivation reject to NW when an invalid IMSI, LBI or EBI is received
    c.      At NAS , dedicated bearer activation/deactivation timer data is freed twice. When the retransmission count > max , timer data is freed inside _eps_release_bearer() as well as after coming out of the function. This is leading to a crash. Provided a fix for this by removing the free after  _eps_release_bearer()
    2. Verified sanity
    3. Executed dedicated bearer TCs

    Update orchestrator's directoryD service to fetch from state service (#865)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/865
    
    This diff updates the Orchestrator's directoryD service
    to fetch from the state service for IMSI_TO_HWID's. It also updates
    the feg_relay service to properly fetch using a networkID since the state
    service keys on (networkID, deviceID, type). For now we will
    just iterate through all servedIDs to find the directory state.
    
    In the future, if we ever need to support a large number of served_ids
    for a given FeG network, this can be optimized by using a secondary index that maps
    IMSI (id) to networkID.

    create ipv6 ping engine (#841)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/841
    
    This diff creates an IPV6 ping engine. The ping engine opens an ipv6 socket. It doesn't yet send or read them (that's in the next diff of the stack).
    
    Docker for mac doesn't work with ipv6 but this diff handles a failed socket open gracefully. Whether or not a machine supports v6, this won't break it.

    Move gateway directoryD service from LTE module to Orc8r
    
    Summary:
    The DirectoryD service is a generic gateway service that allows for
    storing record to have those replicated back to the Orchestrator. Additionally,
    the proto is already defined in the Orchestrator module. As such, this service
    should reside in the orc8r/gateway as opposed to lte/gateway. This diff implements
    that change.

    Summary:
    This diff adds a new RPC service to the DirectoryD proto
    and implements it. This service allows for directory records containing
    a location history as well as other arbitrary identifiers to be
    stored locally in Redis. The gateway state replication service
    will then replicate these back to the Orchestrator, which can then be
    queried from the API/NMS.

    Refactor RedisFlatDict to only store one type
    
    Summary:
    Having the ability to store multiple types of state was complicating
    usages of the RedisFlatDict and exposed clients to be more vulnerable to usage
    mistakes (i.e. not formatting the key correctly, etc.). This diff refactors
    `RedisFlatDict` to only support a single type of state. It also updates current
    uses of this dictionary to work properly with this refactoring.

    Propagate RAT Type passed into LocalCreateSessionRequest into CCRs (#853)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/853
    
    ## Issue
    Currently, aaa-initiated CreateSession properly sets the RatType param  as WLAN, and oai initiated CreateSession properly sets the RatType param as LTE. But the rat type is not used anywhere in sessiond. (See `magma/lte/gateway/c/oai/lib/pcef/pcef_handlers.cpp:107`, `magma/feg/gateway/services/aaa/servicers/accounting.go:145`).
    
    ## Change
    - This diff makes it so that the Rat Type set in session initialization is propagated to session_proxy so that it can be included in the CCR.
    - Includes some style fixes in SessionState.h/cpp and LocalEnforcer.h/cpp
    
    ## Note
    In the credit control request, we need both the RAT type and the IP CAN type, but since we are only supporting EUTRAN and WLAN for the RAT type, we will infer what the IP CAN type must be from the RAT type.

    Add support for rule deactivation in CCA (2/2) (#844)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/844
    
    Our implementation of session_proxy / sessiond currently does not support "Charging-Rule-Remove" in CCA, specifically CCA-Update. When usage monitor quota is exceeded, PCRF should send a CCA-U that specifies which rules should be removed.
    
    This diff covers the sessiond side of changes. When a usage monitor update is received, it will now process the list of ruleIDs given by `rules_to_remove`  and make the `deactivate_flows_for_rules` call to pipelined.
    
    Note: I haven't figured out a good way to handle error if pipelined fails to deactivate the rules. Sessiond just prints that it failed to do so now.

    This diff is updates the `CCADiameterMessage` struct to include a field for `CCADiameterMessage` so that the AVP can be deserialized into the struct properly. I've also added some logic on the `UpdateSession` to translate the list of `RuleNames` and `BaseNames` into a list of rule IDs and propagate them to sessiond.

    adding force reload of page if axios request sent while logged out
    
    Summary:
    If an axios request is sent while user is logged out/not authenticated, res.redirect() doesn't work. Plus, it would redirect to the wrong url i.e. instead of the url of the page that sent the axios request, it would load the url of the request itself.
    
    followed solution from https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/932#issuecomment-307390761 to distinguish between axios request and regular browser navigation requests. On the client side, we force reload the page since that will give us the correct login url.
    
    question: where is a better location to put `axios.interceptors`??  It sets interceptor for axios globally so it only needs to be run once. I tried putting it in `axiosConfig.js` but that didn't work.

    Change FeG docker network mode to host mode
    
    Summary:
    This diff changes the FeG's network mode to `host`. This is
    due to a failure condition that was causing `control_proxy` to crash
    anytime another service was crashing. In the case of a service crashing
    due to a bad config error, we got into a unrecoverable state, since
    mconfig won't work unless control_proxy is running.
    
    Host networking mode also simplifies the feg configuration. This allows
    the mconfig to be the single source of truth for configuration, rather than
    having to configure the same port in the `mconfig` as the `docker-compose.yml`.

    Add a lock for MME state in state manager
    
    Summary:
    The MME and NAS tasks (and even S1AP and Service303) use the same state manager
    to read/write state to data store. This change:
    - adds a get_locked_mme_nas_state call in the state manager to ensure these
       accesses are thread-safe.
    - adds checks in get_mme_nas_state and write_state_to_db to make sure the
      calling thread owns the lock
    
    Also fixed a few formatting issues here.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/826
    
    - The default redist.conf we use for starting up redis defaults to binding to 127.0.0.1. This means that the the db can be accessed only from local services. In our CWAG integration test setup, I want to be able to directly access redis from the test to manually put in static policies to simulate the cloud streaming them down.
    - I've overwritten the redis container command for the integration test to take in a modified redis.conf that does not bind to any address.

    Generalize Metrics Component
    
    Summary: The Metrics component was built with `gatewayID` hardcoded in it, meaning it could only be used for segmenting metrics on gatewayIDs. This moves the specific filter logic out of the Metrics component so the caller now passes in that information, making it much more usable. Specifically this will be used for making graphs that filter on IMSI, APN, etc. for CWF.

    Fix and refactor pipelined arpd flow priorities
    
    Summary:
    Introduce a UE_FLOW_PRIORITY(higher than default priority), this is needed because ARP table has 3 sets of rules -> default, ue_flow, and minimum priority respectively.
    
    Before we had a bug where the drop and the catchall fwd rule where the same priority, which is undefined behavior
    
    Refactored rule installation to make this usable for ue_mac arp functionality.
    Introduced a new yml flag(cwag doesn't need the default ip_block arp stuff)

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/762
    
    Controllers need to call other controllers for performing flow logic specific to other tables(f.e ue alls arp table, MagmaController calls StartupFlows, etc) To handle this we set a future for all apps that is then set when the controller is initialized with the datapath. This approach is tested already and we use it across the unit test framework.

    Fix deserialization of static policies from Redis to sessiond
    
    Summary: Static policies have not been deserializing properly in sessiond. In policydb, the PolicyRule protobufs are stored within a RedisState protobuf before being serialized and stored in Redis. This revision adds that extra deserialization step to sessiond. Now, sessiond will deserialize the policy first as a RedisState, and then from the serialized_msg field, deserialize that into the PolicyRule.

    Only decrement session metric when session is found
    
    Summary: The call to `.Dec()` was made even if the session was not found in the table, creating a new metric series without apn or imsi labels that had a value of -1. Change the call to only be made if the session was found and apn/imsi could be retrieved.

    Summary:

    D17976942 had issues with broken file paths so this should fix that. This diff combines both D18073593 and D17976942. Copying summaries from both my diff and paul's:
    
    Paul:D17976942
    
    > During the FBC hack-a-thon jeffreyhan and I worked on copying the magma nms alarms into a shared module and using it in TG NMS.
    We tried to prevent divergence while adding new features: routes, receivers, suppressions (silences)
    > I tried to make the editing/adding more uniform and easy to add onto, but it's not done.
    This represents work from Fanny, Jeffrey, and myself."
    
    Alex:D18073593
    
    Integrate symphony with FBC alarms
    Paul disabled most of the "custom" alerts functionality. We'll add that back in after this is merged so we can unblock the symphony team. Only critical code review suggestions will not be fixed in this diff.

    Note: There are TLS configuration fields available but since those require storing certificate files on the alertmanager box I'm just preventing those configs from being entered and always setting `RequireTLS=false` on email receivers.

    Fix CI failure by adding gateway_dev role to cwag_dev ansible (#802)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/802
    
    - cwag_dev was not properly creating certs. This lead to the control_proxy container to crash loop.
    - This would break the local VM setup as well, but I believe it was not noticed by anyone since the magma_dev VM creates these certs under `.magma/cache/test_certs` properly.
    - I've pulled out the test_certs creation bit as a separate role and included it in the cwag_dev ansible script.

    fix bug in GetListGatewaysHandler
    
    Summary:
    tldr: get all gateways returns things that aren't gateways
    
    =========================
    because of how configurator.LoadEntities works, if we don't have any entities of type gatewayType (line 215), then entityTKs will be nil, which is great.
    
    but then on line 233, when we pass that nil set of types and keys to LoadEntities, we get *all* of the entities in network nid because the type-key filter (entityTKs) is nil, which means entsByTK is not nil (which it should be). this causes things to show up when they shouldn't when listing gateways.
    
    we can either forego the TK filter approach and just use type filters (which turns line 233 into two configurator.LoadEntities calls, one for orc8r.MagmaGatewayType and one for gatewayType), or we can short circuit it the whole method if the length of ids (line 216) is 0.
    
    I prefer what's been done here because it really ensures that we will only have ents of type MagmadGatewayType or gatewayType.

    The Session IDs generated by the server consist of Calling-Station-ID + Called-Station-ID and are not unique per session.
    Most of APs/WACs provide VALID, UNIQUE and consistent Acct-Session-ID with Auth and Accounting requests and we would be better off
    using them instead of Radius server's non-unique IDs.

    Stop sessiond from deactivating service when monitoring quota has exceeded (#794)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/794
    
    ## Sessiond Background
    When a session is created, the session manager will maintain the state of the session in an instance of `SessionState`. A session maintains, along with other things, two credit pools: `UsageMonitoringCreditPool` and `ChargingCreditPool`.
    
    `UsageMonitoringCreditPool` maintains credit granted by PCRF. This credit is used to send updates to the PCRF after rules marked with the specified monitoring key uses up credit. It is only used for reporting and does not determine whether a service is deactivated or not.
    
    `ChargingCreditPool` maintains credit granted by OCS. Sessiond is responsible for cutting off the user service if this quota is used up.
    
    Both of the pools use instances of `SessionCredit` to maintain data usage.
    
    ## Existing Issue
    Every time a credit is updated, it checks whether a service should be discontinued. This logic did not correctly factor in whether it is a monitoring credit or charging credit. So when a monitoring quota has exceeded, it would incorrectly decide to terminate the service.
    
    ## The Fix For Now
    I fixed this issue temporarily by adding a credit type field to specify what type of credit it is. There are ways to figure out whether it is monitoring or charging by looking at the final action struct, but I decided initializing `SessionCredit` with a type is more explicit. Maybe I will considering making `MonitoringCredit` and `ChargingCredit` that inherit from `SessionCredit`, but I am not sure if that's an overkill :).

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/785
    
    ## What's new?
    - Setup a pcrf rule to pass all traffic
    - Setup a pcrf usage monitor with some quota
    - Send 2048K bytes with the UE sim
    - Look into pipelined's policy usage to assert that the rules are installed and the data volume looks reasonable
    
    ## Note
    - Since there is a bug in sessiond where exceeding usage monitor quota will lead to service termination, I've set the `terminate_service_when_quota_exhausted` flag to false for now for these tests until I come up with a good fix.
    - Thanks Nick for telling me how to setup pipelined client in the test setup! :D
    
    ## Next Steps
    - Talk to PCRF to ensure the correct credit control requests are being sent up, etc.

    than having multiple Redis clients, the GSR will have one client

    NOTE: the added default Identity finder will interpret any valid magma URL with specified network_id as the network level access
    therefore, it should only be used if none of fixed route finders match. Othervice, a handler for URL with path: /magma/v123/operators/<Operator ID, I shouldn't have access to>/.../<network ID that I have access to>/...

    Implement gateway state replication service (#770)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/770
    
    This diff serves to implement the gateway state replication service.
    This service allows for replication of Redis state on the gateway, back
    to the Orchestrator's state service. Going forward, this will allow for
    access gateway high-availability and mobility.
    
    The state replication service works by maintaining Redis clients for
    each type of state to be replicated and an in-memory mapping for each piece of
    state. By periodically comparing version stamps, the state replication service
    can determine what state has changed, and send a request to the Orchestrator
    with those states.
    
    When the service first starts, it resyncs state with the Orchestrator, updating
    it's in-memory mapping with the states that are already in sync.
    
    Note: The state replication service currently only handles additions and modfications
    of state. As of now, deletions will not propagate back to the Orchestrator.

    I tested installing symphony agent on an ENS Ubuntu 18 VM.
    
    Calculating a UID for the snowflake can be done the same way as on CentOS, and now does so for Ubuntu.
    
    The default docker package on ubuntu has a broken `docker login` command - it tries to use an X11 display even though ubuntu server doesn't have one. The script checks to see if the ubuntu version of the package is installed or the official docker version. If it's the ubuntu version, it asks the user to re-install from docker, and provides two links on how to do so.

    Make session_manager buildable independently
    
    Summary:
    SessionManager requires the common library headers to build. Update the lib location based on the
    env variable in the local CMakeLists to correct the include path. This allows for the directory to be buildable
    independently.

    fix parameter of upgrade in ansible-playbook for ovs-prepare (#765)
    
    Summary:
    The following warning occurs when building openvswitch on access gateway by ansible-playbook.
    ```
    TASK [ovs_prepare : Update and upgrade apt packages] ***************************
    [WARNING]: The value True (type bool) in a string field was converted to u'True' (type string).
    ok: [10.0.2.1]
    ```
    This warning is due to a type mismatch of apt-upgrade.
    ※[In the documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/apt_module.html), upgrade parameter is not a boolean, but a string ("dist", "full", "no", "safe", "yes")
    
    This PR changed the parameter of upgrade to a string.

    fix gateways full view bug
    
    Summary:
    as requested by alan.
    
    for some reason it looks like the ?view=full endpoint returns a 500 when a network with a mesh (but no gateway) exists.
    
    if gatewayTKs is nil but there's a mesh associated with the network, configurator.LoadEntities will still return NetworkEntities but of type mesh. if we specify the orc8r.MagmadGatewayType parameter, though, and pass in a nil gatewayTKs, loadedGateways will be appropriately empty

    make Diff.h generic (#758)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/758
    
    I made the diff() function in Diff.h more generic - it'll now work on lists in addition to sets.
    
    I used SFINAE and overloaded the diff() function. The efficient diffing algorithm requires a sorted collection. If a collection has a "sort" member function, it'll be sorted, and if it doesn't the diff() function checks to make sure that the collection is already sorted.
    
    If a collection doesn't have a sort() function and is unsorted, diff() throws an exception.
    
    This won't change the previous behavior of diff() the way we were using it (on a set), but now allows us to use it on a list as well.

    Allow some fields in enb to be empty
    
    Summary:
    It falls back to the network default if not supplied.  From Jacky:
    
    > enodeB provisioning should accept blank fields, with some user-facing indication that unfilled fields will be inherited from network and gateway cellular configuration. Only required fields for enB are cell ID, device class, and TX status
    
    I did find that name, serialID are required too though

    improved Diff.h algorithm (#747)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/747
    
    Updated the diff algorithm to a linear-time implementation based on the std::set_difference algorithm.
    
    std::set_difference only finds the difference between two sets - it doesn't differentiate between added and removed elements, so I re-implemented it instead of just using it.
    
    I created a helper function "diffSorted". In a later diff i'll make it generic and it'll be able to handle any sorted collection.
    
    I also created a couple unit tests for the diff function.

    fix snmp hanging (#742)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/742
    
    This commit fixes a problem where the snmp event thread was hanging and
    thus preventing new snmp requests from being fullfilled. The issue stemed from
    the fact that net-snmp without per session useage is not thread safe. We were
    using it in two threads though. The epoll thread to make requests and the snmp
    loop thread to process responses. This causes an issue where a list becomes
    infinite in size and the function never returns.
    
    To get around this I moved the snmp loop thread into the epoll thread loop which
    I was already meaning to do. In the future we can just confine snmp requests/
    responses to a single thread by using future.via and then we can use the other
    cores for other channels.

    I also added a unit test which creates 3 threads which rapidly perform 10,000 adds to the ErrorQueue. The lack of a runtime error means it's threadsafe (since in 30,000 adds in a few milliseconds you'd likely see an error otherwise).

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/670
    
    ## What's changed
    - checkind is no longer a magma service on the cloud
    - It's gateway-status-reporting logic is moved to the state service so it can read from the state storage
    
    ## Notes
    - checkind obsidian handlers will be deleted after v1 -> v0 migration is done
    - Can't push until the gateway side change of deleting checkin_manager has landed.

    Handle different metric sources more simply (#644)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/644
    
    The metricsd servicer had gotten a little out of date and things had just been hacked onto it to make it work with new exporters and new metric sources. This diff aims to streamline the metricsd pipeline.
    
    Main Changes:
    * Added the concept of a `MetricSource` so exporters can handle metrics differently based on where they originate.
      * This was originally handled with `context.OriginatingEntity` but did not work well
    * Move all labeling to `servicer.go`
      * Previously exporters would append labels based on what was in the context. Move this responsibility to the servicer.
      * Exporters can still manipulate labels (possible use case: based on metric source) if necessary
    * Make the `networkID` label name a constant instead of having it spread across multiple packages
    * Allows `cloud` metrics to be available to network operators since they are no longer tagged with `networkID="cloud"` but rather have a tag `cloudHost` and include the networkID label if necessary

    Fix subscriberdb to deactivate inactive subscribers properly when receiving list of subscribers from the cloud (#736)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/736
    
    # Fix for S188240
    
    ## What was broken:
    - The callback was comparing the list of all subscribers agains the list of all subscribers stored in the local DB. Since a subscriber can be Active, Inactive, or deleted, this logic would only try to detach a subscriber if it is deleted. This diff makes it so that we only compare active subscribers against the list of all subscribers in the local DB.
    - In the detach request, we were passing in a list of subscribers with the string "IMSI" prepended, where the MME expects without it.

    Add a flag to the service which toggles multitenancy. This prevents the manager from labeling each alert with a networkID meaning that the alerts will work on any metric in prometheus.
    * Renamed "networkID" to "filePrefix" in code to better represent how files are split up.
    * Single-tenant clients still use the same handlers and can split rules between different files through the path parameter.

    Update EPS Authentication service to use LTE protos (#728)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/728
    
    In order to make the LTE Orchestrator module not dependent
    on the FeG module, the EPS authentication service needs to use it's
    own copy of s6a_proxy protos. Going forward, this will allow us to
    seperate HSS specific functionality (feg s6a) and EPS Authentication
    functionality. This also unblocks the release of V1, as V1 is targeting
    only LTE and Orc8r modules.
    
    A subsequent diff will re-enable cloud based subscriberDB support by switching the protos
    that the MME uses.
    
    Note: this will break older gateways with `cloud_subscriber_db_enabled`.

    Fix state reporting failure on routing table parse error (#721)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/721
    
    ## What this fixes
    - A partner reported that when the system language was set to Portuguese, the state reporting was not working even though there was no network issues. This was due to an undocumented dependency on the system language being English in the logic that constructs the gateway's status. More specifically, the logic uses linux's `route -n` command and expects the heading section to be in English.
    ```    if heading.split() != ['Destination', 'Gateway', 'Genmask', 'Flags',
                               'Metric', 'Ref', 'Use', 'Iface']:
            return RouteCommandResult(error='Unexpected heading: %s' % heading,
                                      routing_table=[])
    ```
    - I experimented a bit with using `pyroute2` package to avoid using the command and make it language independent, but it ends up being a little bit complicated. So for now, I'm just going to change it so that it prints error and returns an empty list so that it no longer prohibits the state from being sent.
    
    ## Notes
    - We should probably mention `checkin_cli.py` in the documentation of setting up GW <-> cloud connection so that there is a way to check the cloud connection independently from state collecting logic. I've modified checkin_cli to send a dummy state in (D17735861), so it should be an accurate indication on whether a gateway is connected to the cloud.
    - Until I come up with a good language independent solution, we should probably mention in the doc that English is preferred.

    Send only active subscribers down to the gateway (#719)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/719
    
    ## What this fixes
    - There is a bug in the subscriber streaming logic where the cloud sends all subscribers in the system with its state attached (Active/Inactive) while the gateway takes in those subscribers assuming that it is a list of active subscribers.
    - This was leading to a partner-reported issue where deactivating a subscriber would not properly work.
    - I'm fixing this on the cloud's end to reduce the number of subscribers being sent.

    Fix network creation display as new user
    
    Summary:
    A recent diff broke new networks for superusers.  This handles
    superUser, so they get prompted to create a network instead of
    seeing the "see an administrator" page
    
    This also refactors the code to break apart modules to new files.
    Just makes things a little clearer

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/630
    
    ## What's changed?
    - Models used as states now require a `Validate() error` function to be implemented
    - This doesn't change much for now since swagger generates this for each model already.
    
    ## Note
    - Not landing this until enodebd stops reporting the EnodebStatus protobuf struct as state since it doesn't implement Validate.

    Use named volumes instead of directory mount
    
    Summary:
    I've been running magma on fedora, and the docker-compose volume mounts
    haven't been treating me well.  It works great for things that are readonly,
    but write permissions haven't been nice, due to the docker daemon running differently
    than the mounted user.
    
    In looking at what it's used for, they are just used for persisting data across
    restarts.  This is much better used as a named volume, since you don't need
    to even know there's a local directory.

    just get me one please
    
    also move a function out of agent_handler_factory into normal handlers.go because it's used by more than just the agent factory.
    
    possible TODO: refactor all of the "get network and _____ ids" into one method that takes the param path name as an argument. at a certain point though (if we _do_ try to refactor it even more and let it take a list of param path names), this could just devolve into being a super thin wrapper around the obsidian.GetParamValues call we're already making, so let's leave it alone for now.

    This commit adds latencies to the fbc-symphony-device model. A few
    items for reviewers to note. I was thinking usec would be a good unit for

    which is a string rather than an enum. This string might be something like:
      agent-to-device
    Or something else arbitary. The idea here is its very flexible.

    Add metrics to snmp type devices \o/
    
    Summary: For agent devices that gather device state via SNMP, also submit the data as timeseries data to prometheus. These are interface counters, such as byte and packet counts for all/unicast/broadcast/errors. Currently, the entire state path is used, making the metric name very very long and not as human friendly as it could be. While this is less than ideal visually, this makes it really clear in the backend where the data comes from. Adjustments should be made on the UI side to clean this up.

    * had to override the Gateway handler factory because Agents are a little different. That was annoying, but that's what the agent_handler_factory.go file is - mainly copied from gateway_handler_factory.go
    * conversion.go has the logic to turn the agent objects into configurator entities
    * changed configurator client_api.go to return a 404 if a network doesn't exist for an operation

    Add SyncVersions RPC method to the State service (#690)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/690
    
    This diff adds the SyncVersions RPC method to the Orchestrator State service.
    This method takes in Key, Type, and Version and returns the the Key, Type, and Version
    for any state that differs in either Version, or existence (i.e (K,T) doesn't exist).
    
    This will allow gateway components to efficiently re-synchronize their state by first
    gathering which states differ, then either reporting states that differ, or fetching
    states that differ, dependening on which direction the re-sync is being performed.

    Modify blobstore to support version clobbering
    
    Summary:
    With the upcoming implementation of the gateway state replication
    framework, the Orchestrator needs to support version cloberring, where
    the version provided in the blob is stored, rather than just incrementing
    the previously stored version by 1.
    
    Since we consider Gateways to serve as the "master" of their own state, this
    will allow the Orchestrator to remain in sync with gateway State. If the version is
    not provided in the Blob, normal version incrementation will be done. Rather than
    creating a seperate method for this, the `CreateOrUpdate` method is modified to support
    this usecase. This puts the clients in charge of how version incrementation is to be done.
    Since all production usages of blobstore don't supply version, this won't affect any
    existing behavior.

    Add support for traffic gen to UE Simulator
    
    Summary:
    This diff adds support to the UE Sim service to
    allow for triggering traffic tests. This functionality is
    implemented by creating a new RPC method to trigger the
    traffic. The traffic is ultimately generated using `iperf3`.
    
    Currently, the CallingStationID is set to the MAC ADDR of the
    OVS bridge on the test VM. This allows traffic to flow through
    the CWAG since the eth_src for iperf is the bridge mac.
    
    In the future, we should store ue mac address and

    Correctly identify services contributing to list of metas (#675)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/675
    
    In D17193502 the behaviour of StateReporter was changed such that it was now comparing the names of services (which are required to provide metas) against the metas themselves. This caused StateReporter to think that the metas were not being provided, which prevented checkins on SoMA devices.
    
    This is resolved by comparing service names against the actual services that we get the metas from.

    Add the logic for creating bearer based on QoS Info
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    According the VoLTE design doc https://fb.quip.com/ziJEAWsWQFqh , session manager should send bearer creation request to PGW task when the QCI of incoming Gx RAR message is different from the default QCI of a session.
    This diff implemented the logic for checking the QCI and specifying where the PGW GRPC client function for creating bearer should be invoked. Since we don't have a GRPC channel for PGW task yet, we cannot create the `PGWClient` object and make the actual function call.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Store QoS related information in `SessionState`
    2. Check the QCI of incoming Gx RAR message, see if it is different from the default QCI of a session.
    
    **What is affected**
    Nothing should be affected.
    One might see some logs when there is QoS information included in Gx RAR message.

    Summary:
    As requested by OAI team to support VoLTE/dedicated bearer, a bearer ID will be sent with `LocalCreateSessionRequest` from MME when creating a default session.
    Other use cases such as CWF would not be affected. The bearer ID field is optional.

    Add mac_addr conversion to sessiond (#665)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/665
    
    Sessiond recevies Mac address from the AAA
    server as a bytes field. For C++ a bytes field is
    represented as a std::string. Despite this, each char
    is still a byte, not a properly formatted UTF-8 char. Thus
    when this field is sent to the pipelined service as a string.
    
    The following error occurs:
      sessiond         | I0904 05:11:23.442327     1 CreditPool.cpp:132] Credit init failed for imsi 001010000000087 and charging key 1

    Update relay to use V1 network types for network routing (#660)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/660
    
    V0 access network types contained a field called `FegNetworkID` that was
    used to determine which FeG network to send requests to. This caused the `feg_relay`
    service to have to import models from the `cwf` and `lte` plugins, creating ugly import
    cycles. Due to this, CWAG <-> FeG relay wasn't properly implemented.
    
    This diff corrects this by updating the types used in the relay to the versions
    created in V1. It also cleans up an old and unnecessary env variable (FEG HW ID).

    - Strongly type all relevant API payloads
    - Expose a bunch of functions inside the orc8r fab package to facilitate cloud requests for registering gateways
    - Get rid of the generic `register_vm` and move the LTE gateway registration logic into the LTE fabfile
    - LTE gateway registration via `register_vm` now also provisions all network and gateway cellular configs with default values
    - Add a generic network & gateway registration function to the orc8r dev_utils fabfile
    - Change `sys.path.append('../../orc8r/tools')` to `sys.path.append('../../orc8r')` everywhere so that IDE code intelligence works on fabfiles

    Refactor and clean up StateReporter on gateway (#642)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/642
    
    ## What's Changed?
    - Moved checkin_manager's functionalities such as kick starting bootstrap/cert check when checkin fails into StateReporter
    - Moved checkin_manager's kernel_versions_installed polling logic into GatewayStatus as its own class
    - Moved out the grpc client recycle logic into its own class to clean up the logic a bit.
    - Added some basic unit tests (Increasing test coverage by a bit :) )
    - Deleted checkin-manager.py
    
    ## Note
    I've kept some of the print statements such as "Checkin Success" and "Checkin Fail" since many people rely on those for indication of cloud<->gw connection and don't want to make a disruption to the correctness of the docs just yet.
    
    After this is stable, I can remove the cloud checkind service and fully migrate to state based pipeline.
    
    I've also modified some error logs to reduce the space it takes.
    
    From...
    {F210485203}
    To...
    {F210485230}
    
    ## What is affected?
    - Magmad no longer reports to checkind on the cloud
    - Magmad will print "Checkin Success!" and all other related prints if state reporting succeeds/fails.

    Make gateway creation endpoints use 1 RPC call
    
    Summary:
    - Doing gateway creation in multiple RPC calls could lead to situation where the magmad gateway gets created but the cellular gateway does not.
    - Use the new multi-write endpoint in configurator to fix this in the gateway handlers, introducing a `MagmadEncompassingGateway` interface to replace the mutable gateway interface

    Add SPGW GRPC server for processing dedicated bearer requests
    
    Summary:
    This diff adds grpc server for spgw to process messages related to creation and deletion of dedicated bearer.
    This is to be used by session manager to communicate with PGW.
    Integration with session manager is yet to happen in a different diff
    
    This also adds a new stub for a CLI to trigger ded. bearer creation and deletion. Population of fields will happen in a future diff.
    
    In the future, we might want to merge all AGW services into a single service that translated GRPC messages into itti messages.

    Summary:
    For every ue_mac flow add dns/dhcp passthrough flows. These flows will set a special DIRECTION reg value so that inount knows to skip the pipeline
     - DNS is 4 flows, the first 2 are for udp DNS requests matching udp_dst or udp_src depending on pkt direction, the last 2 are equivalent but match for tcp packets(tcp_dst/tcp_src)
     - DHCP is 2 flows matching udp_src/udp_dst to be 68/67
    
    When we delete a ue mac flow we also delete passthrough rules
    
    **INOUT gets a new default flow**
    This flow will detect passthrough flows and forward them to EGRESS table

    Provides an endpoint to get a list of metrics series in prometheus within the given time bounds. This will make it much easier for users to create alerts on metrics since they'll be able to know what is available for them to alert on.

    Size down recommended Orchestrator infra (#631)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/631
    
    For already-deployed Orchestrators, this will involve some manual steps because AWS does not allow you to downsize RDS or EBS.
    
    First, update the `.tf` files in your terraform directory to reflect the new changes.
    
    For EBS:
    
    1. Undeploy the prometheus pod (set `create: false` in the Helm values)
    2. Delete the old metrics EBS volume using AWS console (you may have to detach it from the metrics ec2 worker first)
    3. terraform plan/apply, which should create a new EBS volume
    4. Redeploy the prometheus pod
    
    For RDS:
    
    1. Log into a controller pod (`kubectl exec`) and install `postgres-client-9.6` via `apt` - https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt
    2. Use `pg_dump` and the connection parameters in `/var/opt/magma/envdir/DATABASE_SOURCE` to dump the contents of the `orc8r` database from RDS (e.g. as `dump.sql`)
    3. Manually delete the RDS instance from the AWS console
    4. terraform plan/apply, which should create a new RDS instance
    5. From the same controller pod in step 1, load the pg dump into the `orc8r` database of your new RDS instance - note that the RDS hostname will change!
    6. Update the `DATABASE_SOURCE` file in your `secrets/envdir`, then redeploy the Helm application
    
    Summary of changes:
    
    - Controller worker group -> 2x t3.small
    - Metrics worker group -> t3.medium
    - Metrics datasink -> 64GB EBS volume
    - Orchestrator RDS instance -> 32GB size

    GUTI and ECGI state to proto conversion
    
    Summary:
    As part of Stateless MME, we plan to move the in-memory state of each ITTI task
    to redis data store. This would ensure that UEs which are registered do not
    experience a detach-then-attach behavior whenever the MME process restarts. This
    stack of changes implements statelessness for the MME and NAS task. The feature
    is work in progress and "use_stateless" should be set to false in mme.yml.
    
    This specific change adds state to proto conversions for common structs like
    GUTI and ECGI.

    Adds a simple retry until successful functionality to the sessiond pipelined setup process. If sessiond receives an OUTDATED_EPOCH response that means that pipleined managed to restart twice during the time sessiond tried to set it up(edge case handling).

    Add Sessiond functionality to restore pipelined flows
    
    Summary:
    Adds the necessary functions to restart pipelined and pass the current flows for every subscriber.
    
    For pipelined setup to work we maintain an epoch in sessiond and when the epoch sent from pipelined is different from the one in sessiond we call pipelined setup. The setup function will combine all subscriber sessions(basically all the rules that need to be activated) and create a setup request for pipelined.
    
    Epoch is made global for pipelined as in the next diff we'll be accessing it from the enforcement controller for sesiond pipelined setup verification.

    Track active static rules per session
    
    Summary:
    Currently we don't track active static rules for a session, we only track dynamic rules. Adds a string vector with current active rules to the session class and updates the static rule tracking(mirroring the dynamic rule tracking).
    
    **This is done to retrieve current active static/dynamic rules for the pipelined setup API(resilience project)**

    add `originatingNetwork` label to orc8r alerts
    
    Summary: We need to use networkID="orc8r" in preconfigured alerts to segment them so they're only viewable by deployers. However using that label then obscures the actual networkID of the metric causing the alert, making them more difficult to use. Create a new label that references `$labels.networkID` which gets the networkID from the metric. Also double bracket label references in alert descriptions.

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/1430
    
    ## What is Changed
    - added a v1 endpoint to view reported enodeb state
    - modified enodeb state reporting logic to report a JSON-serialized tuple that deserializes into the swagger EnodebState model.
    
    ## What's affected
    - Not much, other than that you can now view enodeb status in the cloud. Although it should be noted that the state is not always the most up-to-date since it is reported every checkin-interval. (set in magamd gateway config).

    `➜ fbc yarn upgrade --latest`
    Undo change for `"eslint-plugin-prettier": "^2.6.0",` - the style change a lot and can't get it to accept the fb one. Also doesn't work with our IDE integrations.
    Fix errors:
    `➜ fbc yarn eslint --fix .`
    Update sqlite3 binary.
    Manually ensure the packages.json have the same version. I tried running yarn upgrade in each folder to and it didn't do anything. (`➜  fbc cd ../fbcnms-projects && for d in ./*/ ; do (cd "$d" && yarn upgrade --latest); done`)

    Fix URL typo / implement unimplemented connected_enodeb_serials functions (#617)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/617
    
    There was a typo in the lte gateway handlers' url for  /status and /connected_enodeb_serials that mismatched the swagger spec.
    The partial delete and post functions for connected enodeb_serials were missing so adding that now.

    Summary:
    * Adds an endpoint to submit gauges to metricsd, so the metrics will be exported to every exporter configured
      * Chose to just use gauges instead of the prometheus metrics types (gauge/counter/histogram/summary) because the prometheus protobuf is no longer supported, even in prometheus everything just turns into a gauge, and it would make the swagger type a lot more complicated without actually adding functionality
    * Supports timestamps, but will use current time if not provided
    * Values are just floats, labels are name:value string pairs

    view firing alerts + page flow
    
    Summary:
    * view firing alerts
    * navigation between firing alerts, edit alerts, and new alert.
    
    I feel like the way I did the routing is a bit clunky. Also, currently when you go firing alerts -> new alert -> cancel, it goes to edit alerts page. It would be ideal for it to go back to whatever page came before new alert (in this case, firing alerts). But this requires the new alerts component to have context for which component called it, which requires nesting, and it seems silly to me to nest the new alerts route twice - once in Firing Alerts and once in Editing Alerts. Would love any ideas here!

    Install redirection rule with info in CCA
    
    Summary:
    **Context**
    Previously, session manager did not take action when the `FinalUnitAction` was `REDIRECT` although the related information `RedirectServer` was passed from FeG. In this diff, session manager stores the information and pass it to `LocalEnforcer` to install corresponding redirect rule.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Store `RedirectServer` in the `SessionCredit` object when receiving charging credits (Gy)
    2. Pass `RedirectServer` up to `LocalEnforcer` through the `ServiceAction` object when `LocalEnforcer` is checking if updates are required (quota exhaustion). Some cleaning up and refactoring were done since we never pass so many parameters from `SessionCredit` to LocalEnforcer before.
    3. In `LocalEnforcer`, retrieve `RedirectServer` and other information, and install redirect rule through pipelined client.
    
    **What is affected**
    Existing functionality should not be affected.
    OCS initiated redirection should work now.

    orc8r alerts for prometheus
    
    Summary:
    Alerts that are useful for the operator of orchestrator are now shipped with the kubernetes deployment. These alerts will automatically be configured in Prometheus and will be visible from the Prometheus webpage.
    * There is no receiver for these alerts configured, so they are just "alarms" and not alerts. They will be pushed to alertmanager when firing, but not sent to slack, email, etc.
    * If an operator wants to configure a receiver for these alerts, they can modify the alertmanager.yml file.
      * I may add the logic to set an "orc8r receiver" on start of `config-manager` based on kubernetes configurations, but that will be in the future.
      * In general we want to make these alerts available, but unintrusive if not needed
    * Moved `prometheus.yml` into a ConfigMap which accesses values from the Helm chart since this file should never need to be modified, even with dynamic alerts through config-manager.

    I can't seem to run the benchmark tests on my end, so I'm not sure if the worker pool should be larger or smaller.

    Expand duplicate model lookup to include arrays not just structs
    
    Summary:
    Modifying the swaggergen rewrite code to consider duplicate models in type declarations other than structs.
    Since the logic that decides whether to replace models or not was looking at the ast.Field token, it was missing cases where a type was aliased to an array.
    
    For swagger model:
    ```
     baz_array:
        type: array
        items:
          $ref: './importer-swagger.yml#/definitions/importing_def'
    ```
    
    Generated file before the change:
    ```
    import (
            "strconv"
    
            strfmt "github.com/go-openapi/strfmt"
    
            "github.com/go-openapi/errors"
            "github.com/go-openapi/swag"
    )
    
    // BazArray baz array
    // swagger:model baz_array
    type BazArray []*ImportingDef
    ```
    
    Generated file after the change:
    ```
    import (
            models2 "magma/orc8r/cloud/go/tools/swaggergen/testdata/importer/models"

    Improve UE-SIM EAP-AKA AUTN verification
    
    Summary:
    Previously, the UE simulator verified AUTN correctness
    by comparing received AUTN with calculated AUTN to ensure that
    they were equal. According to 3GPP TS 33.102, though,
    this isn't correct.
    
    Instead, the SQN of the received AUTN should be extracted. This SQN
    should then be used to calculate the UE side AUTN. After doing this,
    MAC_A should be verified for equality. Lastly, the received SEQ
    number should be greater than the UE seq number but less than
    limit L. Here we use L = 1 << 28 as this is the most lenient limit defined
    in the spec.

    around it by isolating corejs 2 to *just* `fbcnms/relay` (which is the only place
    that needs it).  Luckily for us, that is also only run on the host machine.

    Deploy metrics containers on separate pods
    
    Summary:
    When running `helm upgrade` the new metrics pod would fail since it needed to get a lock on the prometheus data directory. The old pod still had the lock on it and wouldn't terminate until the new one was running. This required manual intervention to terminate the old pod every time an upgrade was released.
    
    Splitting up the 3 containers (prometheus, alertmanager, configmanager) into 3 pods will solve the problem since prometheus should only be upgraded when the version of the container is changed (which will be rare). Configmanager which is updated on every release can restart without trouble.
    
    Since these containers have shared data, they all need to run on the same node. Using pod affinity we can assure that this happens.

    Retrieve redirect server information in Gy-CCA
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    In the Gy-CCA message, when the `FinalUnitIndication` is `true` and `FinalUnitAction` is `REDIRECT`, the `RedirectServer` field would be populated with redirection related information. `session_proxy` in FeG should parse this piece of information and pass to the `session manager` in AGW.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Add the `RedirectServer` field in the struct for parsing diameter message
    2. Add the `RedirectServer` field in proto message
    3. Implement the conversion from diameter message to proto message
    
    **What is affected**
    Nothing should be affected as session manager did not take this information.
    Gy-CCA should still be parsed and converted to proto message successfully.

    - RAN configs for enodeB's are now optional and will inherit from network/gateway configs when left unfilled (to make registering gateways simpler)

    Revert changes to flow priority and remove register check in metering (#587)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/587
    
    The unittests for pipelined were failing as the flow priority was changed by
    recent addition for DROP_PRIORITY in flows.py for packet_tracer app. As packet
    tracer is still a work in progress, reverting these changes to maintain unit
    test sanity. Also removing check for test packet in metering app.

    Add redirect and restrict_service as possible final unit action
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    Charging credit might come with Final Unit Action (FUA) indicating how to treat the session when it runs out of credit. There are three types of action: `TERMINATE`, `REDIRECT`, and `RESTRICT_ACCESS`. Currently, only `TERMINATE` is supported and is applied to sessions. `REDIRECT` and `RESTRICT_ACCESS` are ignored.
    This diff keeps track of all kinds of FUA. There will be a stacked diff handling `REDIRECT`.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Store final action in the credit object
    2. Pass the final action to Local Enforcer when necessary
    
    **What is affected**
    We could see some debug logs saying the redirect or restrict_access action is not supported if that is the final unit action of an exhausted credit.

    Add 'IMSI' prefix to subscriber ID IMSI
    
    Summary:
    Due to a legacy design mistake of MME to sessiond call (SessionID is a structure consisting of Id - the IMSI istelf & Id Type - Type_IMSI in case of IMSI,
    so - there is no need to prefix actual IMSIs with 'IMSI' prefix AND set type to IMSI, yet MME for some reason does this) & session_manager as well as session_proxy reliance on
    SessionIDs generated by session_manager to start from 'IMSI' to identify the session to be in Magma specific format, this - possibly temporary fix, adds the same IMSI encoding as MME.

    Created a packet tracer that reports table_id which caused packet drop in the pipeline
    
    Summary:
    Implemented packet tracer CLI/grpc service that reports the table_id which caused the packet to be dropped.
    
    One important thing to note here is that ovs already supports some kind of packet-tracing with:
    ```
    sudo ovs-appctl ofproto/trace gtp_br0 in_port=LOCAL,arp,reg5=1
    ```
    It iterates through the tables directly without creating any traffic.
    Our implementation differs in a way that we set a specific register to some value which indicates that this packet is a test-packet. We also install a new flow that matches this register every time a drop-flow is installed.

    since a gateway can depend on its associations, metadata, parent associations, it doesn't really make that much sense to load the magmad gateway model and pass that on as a param to its per model functions.
    Now it takes in the networkID and gatewayID so that they can pull in what they need from the configurator.

    Summary:
    We use `flat` which is in corejs 3, but not 2.  However, 2 is required
    for relay-compiler to execute.  The way relay-compiler links with corejs
    is really weird, so installing them together doesn't work well.  Because
    of this, we should split relay to another package, install the old corejs
    there, and use corej3 everywhere else.

    Upgrade magmad image to bionic to allow for proxied github clones (#581)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/581
    
    This diff updates the base image used for magmad to bionic. This is necessary
    to allow for FeG updates to be proxied through the orc8r. Specifically, the libcurl
    version included in Xenial is too old to be used with an HTTPS proxy. As such, when
    we clone the github repo to extract to new docker-compose file, the clone fails.
    
    Unfortunately, there are no suitable backports for this library,
    so the only option seems to be to upgrade. Since we use python3.5 and python3.6 comes
    by default on bionic, we must install from the python `deadsnakes` PPA.

    Add a PartialGatewayRead and PartialGatewayUpdate framework to have a generic way to modify gateways. (#580)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/580
    
    Added the following to have a generic way to modify all entity components that implement PartialEntityModels as well as reading the physical device/state attached to the entity.
    The setup is relatively similar to the PartialNetwork Update/Read framework. The main difference is that we pass in paramName to grab the appropriate entityKey, and the entityType.
    
    - `GetPartialReadGatewayHandler(path string, model PartialGatewayModel) obsidian.Handler`
    - `GetPartialUpdateGatewayHandler(path string, model PartialGatewayModel) obsidian.Handler`
    - `GetReadGatewayStateHandler(path string) obsidian.Handler`

    Finish migrating from magmad to configurator for nw/gw lookup and reduce error logs (#579)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/579
    
    Remove the conditional on env vars because it should be always reading from configurator now.
    When I was putting the migrating logic in, I introduced more error logs than necessary but now checking for empty hwid before looking up networkID and gatewayID, leading to a bunch of Empty HWID lookup error printed out in the cloud. So fixing that here.

    Add docker upgrader to magmad (#567)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/567
    
    This diff serves to add functionality to magmad to allow for
    orc8r initiated upgrades of docker-based containers. The functionality
    works by parsing a version "0.3.77-1565647911-e53c1fe2" => e53c1fe2
    and then using that tag as the IMAGE_VERSION. The upgrader then clones
    the github repo, checks out that build tag and updates the docker-compose
    file.
    
    Since a docker service cannot recreate itself with a new image, an external
    process must do this. In this case, we just use a cron job checking every 15
    minutes to see if the currently running tag and the updated tag differ.
    Though this leaves a small time period with an unfinished update, if a service
    were to restart for any reason, the docker-compose changes won't be included,
    as docker doesn't update config settings on restart. This ensuresthat we cannot
    get into a bad state during an upgrade.

    create multiple familyMaps of different sizes. when testing performance at some particular size, set the cache's familyMap to the appropriate sized familyMap to avoid adding records multiple times
    
    creating initial familyMap takes ~30 seconds because it has to write a lot of records, depending on what `powersOfTen` is.

    This revision only makes sure that metricsd can run on the proxy tier, but does not ensure that the correct metrics are being collected or exported with the correct labels.
    
    The `Dockerfile` for cloud proxy tier has been updated to include a lightweight build of orc8r with no other modules/plugins.
    
    `supervisord.conf` has been modified so that supervisord will now run metricsd on the proxy tier, as well as the supervisor_logger.

    Add a configurable tolerance margin for extra quota
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    This diff changes the logic for deciding when to deactivate the service (stop the data).
    
    __Old logic:__
    There were two situations when the service would be stopped:
    
    -
    ```
    Pipelined reports data usage
      --> quota is exhausted
      --> sessiond sends update to FeG, hoping to get successful response from core and have more quota granted
      --> get unsuccessful response (still a successful GRPC to FeG)
    ```
    -
    ```
    Pipelined reports data usage
      --> quota is exhausted, and it is the final grant
    ```
    Here was one strange case. sessiond would continue the service if the GRPC to FeG for updating credit usage failed, no matter how much data a session already used.
    
    __New logic:__
    First, two new configurable parameters are introduced:
    1. `terminate_service_when_quota_exhausted`: Set to `false` if we don't want to terminate a session no matter what. Otherwise, set to `true`.
    2. `extra_quota_margin`: Extra number of bytes a session could use after the quota is exhausted. This is like a tolerance margin. After a session used up `(granted quota + extra tolerance quota)`, the service would be deactivated.
    
    Now, there is a new case when the service would be stopped.
    
    -
    ```
    Pipelined reports data usage
      --> quota is exhausted, and the extra quota is exhausted as well
    ```
    Therefore, a session will no longer be able to use data forever when the GRPC for updating credit usage continues to fail. The service will be deactivated when the quota is exhausted no matter what, but we still allow a configurable tolerance margin to make sure the service could continue while sessiond is trying to have a successful GRPC.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Add configurable parameters in `sessiond.yml`
    2. Change the logic for deciding when to deactivate the service
    3. Update unit test
    
    **What is affected**
    Service would be deactivated when the quota is exhausted.

    Fix fab register_vm command to use the new gateway config (#545)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/545
    
    The lte gateway fab command for registering a gateway was still using the old gateway config, resulting in an error `Exception: Received a 400 response: {"message":"Invalid Gateway Record, Error: validation failure list:\nhardware_id in body is required"}`. This changes it so that it's able to properly register a gw.

    It is assumed that by the time enodebd is fetching parameter values, the state machine is aware of which parameters are present, and which are not. This fixes an edge case which raises an error:
    
    - state machine should be in initial REM state
    - set the state machine to reboot the enodeb
    - now the state machine will be in a state that assumes parameter presences are known

    The important file is `fbc/flow-typed/npm/material-ui/core_v1.x.x.js`
    
    I'd like to ship this ASAP because:
    1) This changes how we type WithStyles and will cause flow errors in new diffs
    2) As a result, merge conflicts are annoying.

    withStyles fixes
    
    Summary:
    It seems like the style of `theme.spacing.unit * 3` is still occasionally being added - this is deprecated.
    This diff fixes it for the use of `withStyles`. It doesn't fix it for `makeStyles` since that also accepts using props in the css which I can't figure out how to type properly.
    
    The reason this diff works is because "StyleRules is actually a general enough type that it is a supertype of functions. Remember, functions are objects too. So, you want Flow to notice that styles is a function type, and typecheck it against StyleRulesCallback"
    More can be read here: https://fb.workplace.com/groups/flow/permalink/2680931811955417/
    
    I also flipped the order of StyleRules and StyleRulesCallback because this will cause flow errors if people change it incorrectly.

    Summary:
    **Summary**
    This change makes session manager able to handle incoming session creation request with existing IMSI. There are three possible cases:
    1. A new session: normal case, send create session through FeG.
    2. IMSI is duplicated, but the session config is different: terminate the session, create a new session with this IMSI.
    3. The session is completely duplicated: do nothing.
    
    **Implementation**
    Add logic to check whether the IMSI or the whole session is duplicated.
    
    **What is affected**
    Nothing should be affected.
    Session creation should work as normal.

    Add support for HSS initiated de-registration for SWx (#532)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/532
    
    This diff adds support for Registration-Termination to both the HSS
    and SWx Proxy services. This diameter command requests to the AAA server to kick
    the provided subscriber off of the network. In order to support this functinality,
    the HSS must keep a mapping of clients and their IP addresses. It should re-use
    an existing connection if the diameter connection already exists, otherwise
    the request will not succeed.
    
    In order to more easily test this functionality, an interface for the SWx proxy to
    relay is extracted to allow it to be mocked out. Support for the call from the
    SWx proxy service to FeG-Relay will be added in a later diff.

    Implement the rest of the radiusd service (#525)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/525
    
    This revision implements the actual functionality of the radiusd service.
    
    - Fetches the prometheus metrics from the radius server
    - Processes the metrics and re-exports them to orc8r
    
    To read in metrics exported from the Radius server, and re-export them to orc8r, we've created the MetricAggregate interface. This handles reading in the MetricFamily exported from Radius, and then updating the corresponding collector in radiusd's prometheus registry.
    
    A wrapper is created for the prometheus default registry, in registry_wrapper.go. The single Update function takes in the exported metrics from Radius, and will create and register new metrics, and prevent repeat registrations.

    Add Grafana pod to orc8r metrics deployment (#505)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/505
    
    * Provide a grafana container/pod for orchestrator deployments
    * Grafana is preconfigured with an Orchestrator dashboard showing relevant system and service level metrics
      * Cache utilization - how much of the prometheus cache is filled up
      * Service Memory - memory used by each magma service
      * Targets up - if prometheus is successfully scraping targets
      * Get Metrics Status - count of services sending metrics to metricsd
      * Samples scraped - Number of samples scraped by prometheus
      * scrape time - Time it took for prometheus to scrape each metrics endpoint
      * Prometheus Query Time - Time spent by prometheus query engine
      * Controller disk usage
    * The preconfigured dashboard can be modified by changing the dashboard's json file and rebuilding the grafana container
    * This is designed to be run as a stateless pod. It's much simpler this way and doesn't lose *much* functionality. This is also how most monitoring systems run grafana as far as I can tell.
      * The idea is that this dashboard is really all you want to persist. If you need to drill down and perform extra queries you still can, but they won't be persisted over pod restarts
    * However, you can still configure it to be stateful by providing a volume configuration in the helm values. In this case, any dashboard you create will stay in that volume and persist over pod restarts

    * Some users may want to keep track of their alert configurations in some kind of version control system
    * Bulk upload allows them to keep a file of alerting rules wherever they want, and then sync prometheus with this configuration in one step
    * Note: you cannot delete rules in bulk. We can revisit this if needed, but I don't think it would be a good idea to have that ability.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/473
    
    Recently, we've encountered the need for Destination-Host to be configurably
    included or excluded in Diameter requests sent from the FeG. This option is in line with the
    specs of SWx, S6a, Gx, and Gy. This diff implements this functionality by adding an mconfig
    parameter to the DiameterServerConfig. During the function where the dest-host and dest-realm
    AVPs are added to outgoing diameter requests, we first check this configuration before adding
    dest-host.

    Limit size of prometheus-cache (#459)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/459
    
    * In the situation where prometheus stops scraping the cache, but metrics still get sent to it, we want to limit the size of the cache so it doesn't use up all the memory of the host.
    * Also add this information to the /debug page and add a flag to show the full text or just stats.
    * Add internal metrics which are scraped by prometheus to provide something to be alerted on

    Create custom swagger codegen tool and swagger DSL extension
    
    Summary:
    - For V1, because swagger files will be referencing between each other, we need to set up a custom tool to manage cross-file dependencies
    - Do this by first defining an extension to the swagger DSL (`magma-gen-meta`), which encodes the dependencies between spec files and some other stuff about what types are generated. The "other stuff" will be used in a later diff when we walk the ASTs of generated files to change references.
    - Add a new `swaggergen` tool which reads this DSL extension and copies all dependencies into the local working directory before generating models. This means no more `cp ...` inside `go:generate` directives - you just "import" the files that you want to use at the top and let the tool handle everything.
    - Swagger will generate types for all referenced files as well. We don't actually want this - each defined struct should only be generated into 1 Go package. This tool will next replace references to these duplicated structs to the packages which "own" them by editing the ASTs of the generated files.

    Add support for upgrading gateways through orc8r (#448)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/448
    
    This diff enables proxying docker and github requests
    through the orc8r. This is useful for production gateways that
    cannot access any other parts of the internet. It works by
    forwarding from nghttpx's 9444 to localhost 3128 where a
    squid forward proxy is running. This is necessary as nghttpx
    does not work as a forward proxy for anything other than
    simple GET,POST forward proxying. Thus without squid,
    HTTP CONNECT requests fail.
    
    The squid configuration is the default for minimum access.

Simply check for protocol and add/remove it from prometheus/graphite addresses respectively.

    Modifying docker-compose so that the controller service waits for postgres to be ready (#436)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/436
    
    Currently, the state/device/configurator services fail to start properly because they make calls to the db (postgres) container before it is ready. Adding a script to wait until the db is ready.
    References: https://docs.docker.com/compose/startup-order/, wait-for-it script taken from https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it
    
    Also adding error checking where it was missing in state / configurator.

    Fix potential nil pointer dereference bug in GatewayViews (#427)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/427
    
    There is a possibility for a nil dereference that could be causing some issues in GatewayViews.
    The logic for loading all configs works by first loading all gateway entities requested. And then looking through their associations for configs.
    Gateway Configs are stored as follows, which each config entity has the gatewayID as its key:
    ```                [magmad_gateway_entity]
                           |           |
    [lte_gateway_config_entity]  [wifi_gateway_config_entity]
    ```
    The current logic breaks if the magmad gateway has associations to non-config entities.

    Add StartAuth to simulate starting authentication (#421)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/421
    
    The authentication protocol is started with an EAP identity request to the UE. The UE's response is wrapped in a RADIUS packet.
    
    The `CreateEAPIdentityRequest` function simulates firing off this initial request, and returns the RADIUS packet with the UE response.

    Add RADIUS layer on top of EAP-AKA support in UE SIM (#420)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/420
    
    This adds UE-side Radius support on top of the EAP and EAP-AKA handlers.
    
    Because there won't be a separate TWAN simulator, Radius handlers have been added to the UE Simulator.
    Specifically, it wraps EAP packets -> Radius packets, and vice versa.
    The verification step is missing right now because the simulator doesn't keep sessions or other state - that will have to come down the line.

    Change error handling in ReportStates to propagate back individual error" (#423)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/423
    
    The current implementation of ReportStates rejects all states if any of them cannot be serialized/deserialized properly. This leads to gateway status not properly being propagated if any of the device states are ill formatted.
    Additionally, the current implementation only returns the first error it encounters.  So it's not always clear what else could be failing other than the reported error.
    
    I've changed it to return a list of (type,key,error) for better clarity.

    Add a configurator backed implementation of FullGatewayViewFactory (#416)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/416
    
    Since we have plans to phase out usage of protobuf structs in the client layer of orc8r, I've modified the GatewayState to include swagger model versions of AccessGatewayRecord and GatewayStatus. I've marked the protobuf fields as deprecated.
    (I've also moved some of the swagger model <-> protobuf conversion code into view_factory to avoid cyclical import. Although, as soon as we deprecate the protobuf fields fully we can delete those code.)
    
    I've moved the GatewayState serde from checkind into pluginimpl to consolidate the existing serdes.

    Summary:
    In pyinventory integration tests we would need user to connect to inventory with.
    Instead of creating it during the test let's create default one that will only be available in development env.
    This will also improve developer velocity and would save the need to run `setAdminPassword`

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/1091
    
    After D16086703 (and the corresponding fix D16095716), we noticed that we have these nicely generated relay flow types, and instead we're using manually hand-typed ones (that are wrong) and don't get updated. This leads to a ton of bugs like specifying fields that don't exist, specifying unused fields, coding mistakes, etc.
    
    This enables lint for that.
    This is a HUGE problem.

    Make grpc call to AAA when terminating session in enforcer (#402)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/402
    
    **Summary**
    After a session received last update and exhausted the quota, sessiond should make a GRPC call to AAA service to terminate the session.
    
    **Implementation**
    When terminating service, sessiond also check if the session is a CWF session. If so, use `AAAClient` to send session termination to the AAA service.
    
    **What is affected**
    LTE session should not be affected.
    CWF session should be terminated when running out of quota without more grant.

    **Summary**
    Similar to PipelinedClient and PgwClient, this AAAClient is used by sessiond to communicate with AAA service. Currently we only plan to support session termination initiated from sessiond.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Generate C++ codes from `accounting.proto`
    2. Call the generated RPC functions from AAAClient's functions
    
    **What is affected**
    Nothing is affected since this class is not used by anyone.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/404
    
    This diff serves to no longer build OVS v2.8.1 for the
    Carrier WiFi Access Gateway from source, but rather installs
    the .debs from Magma's pkg repo. This diff helps fix an
    installation error that was occuring from a compilation

    Speed up go and radius docker builds
    
    Summary:
    This diff speeds up go-based builds by 2x and
    optimizes the radius server to only copy the necessary
    code it needs to build (AAA server).
    
    This speeds up go builds by allowing the baseImage to be overridden
    with a build argument. We then create a base xenial image that has
    a gocache added to it. This makes subsequent builds faster since
    the image has cached build objects. Docker builds will still work
    normally without this argument supplied.
    
    Steps:
    One time only: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.cache.yml build`
    
    Then any time you want to build: `docker-compose --build-arg baseImage=feg_cache build`

    Summary:

    **Summary**
    `sessiond` needs to invoke grpc `terminate_session` defined in `accounting.proto` to tell `AAA` service to terminate a session. The first step is generating C++ codes.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Change the `void` defined in `context.proto` to `Void` since `void` is a reserved word in C
    2. Edit CMakeList
    
    **What is affected**
    Nothing should be affected.

    Move docker magmad.yml to default feg configs (#393)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/393
    
    Previously, we had a seperate directory for docker specific configs. This
    is a bit risky given that they're not likely to be known and will go un-updated. This
    diff moves these to the default configs directory at `magma/feg/gateway/configs`
    and symlinks any legacy configs to ensure a Vagrant dev env still works.
    
    Note: the NAT vagrantfile config is removed to ensure that FeG VM can still
    connect to the orc8r. This was currently broken.

    Since devmand gateway configs only consist of a list of registered devices, instead of saving those devices as configs we will maintain associations between the gateway entity and the device entities.
    
    I have also duplicated tests to test the MigratedFuncs, and I also dded some additional unit tests to check the entities' association behavior.

    Use configurable usage reporting threshhold ratio
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    In D13479900, a configurable bytes limit on usage reporting was introduced. However, it does not work very well with monitoring updates (Gx) because charging credits (Gy) and monitoring credits (Gx) are granted differently. Therefore, this configure limit is removed in this diff, and available bytes is used as the new reporting limit.
    Also, a new configurable parameter `usage_reporting_threshold` is introduced to make `sessiond` report usage earlier when the quota is **almost** exhausted.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Remove the bytes limit on usage reporting set in `sessiond.yml`
    2. Use available bytes since last report (`total allowed bytes - reported bytes`) as the usage reporting limit
    3. Report updates when
    ```
    available bytes since last report * usage_reporting_threshold
      <= used bytes since last report
    ```
    4. Add a unit test to show that `sessiond` is able to report usage before completely using up the quota
    5. Update related unit tests which report more usage than granted quota
    
    **What is affected**
    The usage updating behavior of `sessiond` is changed.

    Migrate Wifi Gateway Config to fit configurator association model (#1066)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/fbc/pull/1066
    
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/385
    
    Since mesh and wifi gateway configs have a bidirectional dependency, this diff modifies the wifi gateway config logic to support this.
    Each mesh has associations to gateways that it has and each gateway config has a meshID field that represents which mesh network the gateway is part of. So any time the gateway config is modified, the change should be reflected in the mesh entity associations field.
    
    This feature can be turned on by the USE_NEW_HANDLERS env variable. Tests are duplicated to test both versions.

    Migrate Mesh and Mesh config REST handlers to use configurator (#378)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/378
    
    the rest API for mesh now has the migration implemented, so that if "USE_NEW_HANDLERS" is set to 1, it will use configurator instead of mesh.
    
    The current REST API handlers being used have moved to mesh_handler_legacy.go in the same folder. The newly implemented handlers are in mesh_handler.go
    
    I've also duplicated the mesh_handler tests to test both "USE_NEW_HANDLERS=1" and "USE_NEW_HANDLERS=0" case. (In mesh_handler_test.go and mesh_handler_legacy_test.go respectively)
    
    The wifi module now has a orc8r/const.go file with all configurator related constants defined.

    2. Implement pipelined client function for adding UE MAC flow
    3. Call the client function when creating CWF session
    
    **What is affected**
    When creating a CWF session, session manager makes rpc to `pipelined` to add UE MAC flow before activating rules.
    Creation of LTE session should not be affected.

    Add lint errors for `$FlowFixMe`.
    This is used to silence type errors recognized by Flow. `$FlowFixMe`'s are temporary work-arounds and are distinct from semi-permanent fixes like `$FlowIssue`.
    
    Couldn't use the flow package (`flowtype/no-flow-fix-me-comments`) because it doesn't work. It literally does nothing.
    Disabled this for tests since it seems to be a fairly common testing practice.

    Add string uppercase conversion to orc8r service registry map
    
    Summary: When services are added to the registry in `service_registry.go` they are added with the name: `strings.ToUpper(name`). To ensure that services are accessed from the registry using the same name, this adds in a `strings.ToUpper()` call in the dictionary access. The original toUpper() appears to be due to legacy code from importing the service names as environment variables in `orc8r/cloud/docker/controller/Dockerfile`, so it may be worth looking into removing the need for upper case names or documenting that service names must be in all caps

    Migrate cellular config REST handlers to use configurator (#367)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/367
    
    The cellular configs API now supports the migration to configurator.  If "USE_NEW_HANDLERS" is set to 1, cellular configs will be backed by configurator, not configs.
    
    I have duplicated the tests so that both versions are tested. The original tests are moved to cellular_handlers_legacy_test.go.
    
    I've also modified the config type switch logic to look at the last index for the 'gateway' or 'network' keyword, not the second.

    Switch config model validation to be done with swagger models not protobuf (#366)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/366
    
    Since we are now switching over to storing swagger models instead of protobuf, I've moved the validation logic to be in terms of swagger models.
    This will help when migrating the cellular handlers to use configurator, so that I can validate the inputs without converting into protobuf, which would require the now deprecated ToServiceModel function.
    
    I also modified some of the error messages in the tests to match the new error messages.

    Change configurator backed config handler impl to differentiate between gateways and other network entities (#365)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/365
    
    The configurator CRUD handlers for config will now differentiate between entities and gateways. (mesh vs magmad_gw for example).
    
    Since magmad gateway allows for multiple config types to be stored under one gateway, the configurator implementation creates 'config' entities that have associations to the main gateway.
    However most entities that we deal with do not have this behavior. (ex. mesh: /networks/{network_id}/mesh/{mesh_id}/configs).
    So I've implemented a set of handlers for regular entities that have 1 entity - 1 config relationship.

    Summary:
    The format of get_magma_config changed, which broke the seemingly only
    usecase of it in the dns thing I wrote (which shouldn't break anything, just

    It seems like SoMA is the only user of this script, so instead, let's make it simpler
    to make it friendlier for bash parsing.
    
    Namely:
    1. Output one config per line (for piping)
    2. Guarantee space separation (to allow a simple cut to get variables)

    Having server and UI exist in the same project has caused quite a few problems.
    This is an attempt to separate them to different packages.  This will allow us
    to code and configure them in isolation, remove UI source from production builds,
    and (possibly) replace the server component with something of another language in
    the future.
    
    Would love comments on how to improve it beyond this implementation.

    This diff implements a pipelined app `ue_mac` to match packets based on

    controls Table 0 for the LTE AGW is not present in the Carrier WiFi solution.
    
    The app supports both adding and deleting flows based on MAC addr, but for now an
    RPC only exists for the addition of a subscriber/mac addr. If necessary, an RPC can
    easily be added to support deletion.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/355
    
    This diff serves to add the RPC interface to pipelined for the new application that
    will be used to add flows to table 0 for the CWAG. This is necessary as the LTE AGW has table
    0 controlled by the EPC. Since this isn't the case for CWF, we need to add a new application
    to allow PCEF functionality.

    Handle LTE/WIFI session creation differently (#336)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/336
    
    **Summary**
    `sessiond` needs to support the creation of WIFI session. `aaa` service will make GRPC call to create session with some fields missing.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Check the `RATType` field in session creation message to distinguish the creation of LTE/WIFI session
    2. Populate the session creation message which will be sent to the `session_proxy` in FeG with fields available in LTE/WIFI session creation message. There is some difference.
    
    **What is affected**
    `sessiond` should be able to create an WIFI session without affecting the old process of creating an LTE session.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/333
    
    **Summary**
    Both RAR and update response message could contain revalidation timeout which is a type of event triggers that requires `sessiond` to send an update after the timer expires. This diff implements the logic required in handling update response message.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Check whether revalidation timer is presented in the update response message and schedule an update if it is required.
    2. Update related unit tests.
    
    **What is affected**
    `Sessiond` should schedule and send an update if revalidation timeout is one of the event triggers in update response message.
    Nothing else should be affected.

    Implementation of revalidation timer for RAR (#334)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/334
    
    **Summary**
    `session_proxy` in FeG might send `EventTriggers` and `RevalidationTime` to `sessiond` in the GW through RAR and CCU-A, but the `sessiond` does not have the implementation to trigger a CCU-R when the timer expires. This diff takes the information related to revalidation timer in RAR and implement the logic to trigger a CCU-R. There will be another diff doing the similar thing using CCU-A.
    
    Some `using google::protobuf::RepeatedPtrField;` are removed as I noticed they are not needed.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Get revalidation time from RAR message when `RevalidationTimeout` is one of the `EventTriggers`.
    2. Schedule a rpc call to send CCU-R to `session_proxy` using EventBase.
    
    **What is affected**
    1. `sessiond` will send a CCU-R when revalidation timer it receives from RAR expires.

    Improve withAlert
    
    Summary:
    The generics on `withAlert` are wrong. We want it to take in a component that knows how to use the `WithAlert` type, pass those in internally in `withAlert`, and not require you to pass it externally.
    
    Because of the incorrect types, many callsites used an empty object, resulting in no flow coverage on their components. This can be seen by the flow errors in those components (which I am not fixing because I am unsure on how to test).
    
    I stumbled upon this when looking at D15528882 and thinking of a way to the `withAlert` use.

    Change feg docker services to run using bind networking (#345)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/345
    
    Previously, the Federated Gateway's services could only run in host networking
    mode. Due to Mac's lack of support for host networking, this caused some issues with
    integration testing. This diff introduces a few changes to allow bind networking
    while still remaining backwards compatible with Vagrant.
    
    The main change this diff introduces is to make `service_registry.yml` a single source
    of truth for the FeG's service registry. The main change needed for docker bind networking
    is to set the ip_address used for each service as the service name (i.e. using magmad rather
    than localhost). Rather than having two `service_registry` files (one for Vagrant and one
    for Docker), the ansible role for the feg is updated to add localhost to /etc/hosts for each
    service in that file.
    
    Note: Since docker-compose doesn't yet support supplying sctp for a port, this will
    have to be done manually using `docker-run -p ...`. If we want to use a script to do this,
    we can add this in another diff.

    Add pipelined and sessiond services to the CWAG
    
    Summary:
    This diff serves to add pipelined and sessiond services to
    the CWAG. These services are necessary for the CWAG to function as
    a PCEF. To comply with Magma's push to use docker, these services
    are built with docker images, one for python (pipelined) and one
    for C (sessiond). Since sessiond relies on a few custom packages,
    the sessiond image is built using a base debian-stretch image.
    Eventually, we should build any custom packages for xenial
    to ensure that everything runs using the same base image.
    
    The pipelined image also manually builds and installs OVS v2.8.1.
    This is necessary for pipelined to use `ovs-vsctl` and `ovs-ofctl`.
    To speed up installation in the future, we should host the `.deb.`
    packages. Ths will speed up VM installation as well.
    
    Lastly, this diff adds necessary service configs and OVS bridge
    configuration to the CWAG ansible role. These may have to be
    tweaked once further pipelined testing takes place.

    Helm charts for metrics services
    
    Summary:
    These templates spin up 3 new pods to handle all metrics services:
    * Metrics - runs prometheus, alertmanager, and the configmanager
      * All need to be on the same pod because of shared data
    * Prometheus-cache - runs the 'pushgateway' replacement which is what the controller will send metrics to
    * Graphite - Runs all graphite services
    
    * Each of those pods has a corresponding service to allow cross-pod communication.
    * In this basic setup all of the volumes are either `emptyDir`s or `hostPath`s but are passed in through values so you can simply change the value of a volume to be EBS or something else and it will still work.

    Sort datapoints in prometheus cache instead of only popping oldest
    
    Summary:
    Investigation into prometheus scraping behavior showed:
    * Multiple datapoints actually can be scraped at once but only if
      * The datapoints are in order with oldest timestamp on top
      * Datapoints do not have a timestamp that is older than any previously scraped point for the given series
    * This means we can scrape multiple datapoints per scrape request which means pushing more often than pulling will not cause dropped datapoints
    * If datapoints come in with older timestamps than previously scraped they will be dropped, but they would have been dropped even with the previous scrape strategy so this does not produce any extra drops

    Add example fuzz target
    
    Summary:
    In order to improve the security/stability of the MME, we want it to be robust against malformed user (UE) input. One method of doing this is fuzzing.
    
    Here, we add a fuzzer that models corrupted S1AP packets and user controlled NAS packets.
    
    NOTE: that fuzzing these right now essentially just fuzzes the S1AP decode logic and doesn't make it further as eNB has not been associated. This will be easier to fix once stateless MME has been finished as we can restore state from a snapshot with each fuzzing run instead of sending the right ITTI messages to "prime" the MME for fuzzing.
    
    Further, the current test starts a "mock" SCTP task and the real S1AP task, which drops the packet. Once we have the correct S1AP state to not drop the packet, we also need to start MME and NAS task to receive the packet.

    Add mock task implementation for fuzzing
    
    Summary:
    In order to improve the security and stability of the MME, it would be helpful to add fuzz testing. However, to do this we need tasks to be able to run independently of one another.
    
    This adds mock tasks -- used to fuzz tasks independent of one another. These mock tasks can be brought up by the main thread and their messages queues synchronously read.

    Remove epoll use from intertask_interface
    
    Summary:
    Previously, ITTI had an API to listen for file/socket descriptor events. This required it to watch more than one fd (normally just message present semaphore). This meant that ITTI needed to use epoll to check if an event was present.
    
    Now that this API has been removed, ITTI only needs to track one fd. Therefore we can remove epoll and just use a blocking read instead.

    Make OAI logging non-optional
    
    Summary:
    Currently, there is a compile option to disable logging in the OAI codebase. This is present from OAI needing to run on extremely constrained systems. We do not have this limitation as our systems need to run our big python processes. Additionally, MME supports reducing/disabling logging output after compilation making this further unnecessary.
    
    Therefore, lets remove another conditional compilation flag.

    Sample postprocessor
    
    Summary:
    This diff attempts to implement a way to do ODS tagging as described by
    xjtian offline. Hopefully this is a faithful translation.
    
    ODS tagging via metrics bridge is described here: https://fb.facebook.com/groups/576064506092161/permalink/737556396609637/?comment_id=737557159942894
    
    tl;dr: You add a label called "tags" then put csv in it.
    
    Soma has previously hacked in tagging by using a rapdio query + ODS republish,
    but it's fragile and makes everyone who gazes upon it sad.
    
    The SoMA hacked aggregations are under the keys:
    
      soma.mesh.<NID>.<MID>             # Example: soma.mesh.mesh_dev.one
      soma.device.<NID>.<MID>_id_<DID>  # Example: soma.device.mesh_dev.one_id_facefaceface
    
    This adds new aggregations, with the intent of deleting the old ones
    
      magma.soma.<NID>            # Example: magma.soma.mesh_dev
      magma.soma.<NID>.<MID>      # Example: magma.soma.mesh_dev.one
      # For completeness, existing metrics are under
      magma.<NID>.<MID>_id_<DID>  # Example: magma.mesh-dev.one_id_facefaceface
    
    There are a variety of good things that will happen if we do this, including:
      * No more crazy hacks that we'll have to explain to ODS better
      * Less time lag on aggregate stats (more responsive alarms)
    
    We will continue generating some of our stats still for things that must be
    observed externally:
      * Whether the device is "alive" or not
      * Network flow analysis like mesh min-cut, which cannot be calculated on device

    This diff follows https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/diff/D15562556/
    to try and restore functionality.
    
    In the above diff, getting mcconfigs as structures is mostly deprecated, instead
    relying mostly on returning dicts.
    
    This diff attempts to patch things over.
    
    The main change is that the returned value is a dict. I originally had convinced
    myself that getting unset values from the structure would be different than
    getting unset values from the dict, but don't think that's actually true in
    practice. I left those in for your consideration, but the minimum form of
    this diff is a 1-liner.

    Add sctpd service to EPC (#320)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/320
    
    As part of the effort to make MME stateless, we need a way to preserve state across MME restarts for each subcomponent. This includes SCTP. Unfortunately, the kernel doesn't offer any facility to keep an SCTP socket alive across process restarts. Therefore, we are factoring out MME SCTP facilities into a separate, more stable service, sctpd.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add classes for sctp context and associations
    Since we are factoring out sctp from MME into a C++ based service, we will do SCTP bookkeeping in a C++ manner (more clear/type safe).
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add util file for temporary logging and sctp config
    To support sctpd, we need to have basic logging facilities and sctp socket manipulation. Use of MagmaLogging is planned for the future but is not used right now (#movefast).
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add SctpUplink client stubs
    Here, we add the sctpd uplink grpc client so that the sctpd can communicate to MME: upstream data packets, new associations and closed/reset associations.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add sctp listener thread implemention for upstream tx
    Here, we add a listener thread implementation to wait for new associations and data packets available on an sctp socket. This uses the previous stcpd uplink client to relay these events to the MME.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add SctpDownlink rpc server implemention for downstream tx
    Here, we add the sctpd downlink server implementation. This listens for communications from MME requesting for an sctp connection to setup or to send a downlink packet (mme -> enb) on an existing connection.
    
    The downlink server will be responsible for spawning the sctp listener thread (upstream) after an initialization request is received from the mme.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add main sctpd file and associated build files
    Here, we add the main sctpd file. This is in charge of launching the downlink server (which in turn waits for MME connection).
    
    Additionally, we add the files necessary to build sctpd (CMakeLists.txt and changes to Makefile)
    
    ## [magma][mme] Make log.h/c compatible with cpp
    Currently, including log.h from a C++ file generates compile errors due to C++ being more strict with char * vs const char *. This diff fixes log.h to be C++ compatible
    
    ## [magma][mme] Add appropriate includes to sctp_messages_types.h
    Currently, sctp_messages_types.h doesn't include the proper types to compile on its own.
    Let's add those.
    
    ## [magma][mme] Change sctp task to use sctpd
    Here, we modify MME's sctp task to defer to sctpd for all sctp related communications instead of locally managing the sctp sockets.
    Note: at this point in time sctpd is effectively stateless. This does not play well with the stateless-less MME across restarts. This will be handled better in a following (stacked) diff.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Move socket fd into SctpDesc
    The socket descriptor is a logical part of an SCTP description (state). Let's put it there.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Class-ify sctp_listener to make shutdown easier
    Currently, communicating with the listener thread is limited to pass parameters to the thread construction. Since, the handle returned is just the std::thread object, don't have easy insight or control over the threads behavior. Let's put the listener thread into a controlling class with an interface similar to a grpc server (Start, Stop, Wait methods).
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add force restart option to sctpd for stateless-less deployment
    Right now, sctpd is stateless while MME is stateless-less. This doesn't work out well when MME restarts unexpectedly as there is residual state in sctpd not reflected in MME. This diff adds a force_restart option to sctpd.init so that MME can request sctpd to open a new connection, therefore resetting the state.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Configure socket options to fail hard
    Currently, we encounter an error in s1ap tester where an sctp socket is opened successfully, but s1ap tester is unable to communicate with the eNB. The likely cause is s1ap tester not closing the socket properly after failing a test. Additionally, we have SO_REUSEADDR set on the socket which allows us to open another socket even if the other has not closed properly disguising the issue.
    Let's remove the SO_REUSEADDR socket option so that we fail hard whenever this is the case.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Update sctpd to use references instead of shared_ptr's
    In this diff we change various uses of shared_ptr to refs to be more in line with C++ style. Additionally, we mark certain methods as const to show they have no side effects.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add comments to classes/methods exposed in header files
    Previously, sctpd didn't have comments in file headers. Let's add those so the code is better documented.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Use glog/magma_logging instead of XLOG
    Previously, sctpd used printf for logging. Let's change it to use magma_logging (and therefore GLOG) instead to get more robust/controllable logging behavior.
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Apply clang format to sctpd
    Some of the past diffs for sctpd have had formatting errors. Rather than fix them in each diff and deal with rebasing issues let's fix them all at once with clang-format
    
    ## [magma][sctpd] Add sctpd setup to provision setup and systemd configs
    Previously, we had to manually run sctpd to test and run it as part of EPC. Let's add sctpd to the configuration files so that it is run automatically by magmad/make start.

    This removes the dependency on `node-pre-gyp` and its build process, but also makes this prone to breaking easily since versions are hardcoded and we will need to go update those if anything is updated.

    When the mconfig is initially loaded, the configs are loaded using different keys depending if it loads from the default directory or the override directory, loading with "configs_by_key" and "configsByKey" respectively. The load state is unknown at start so both keys need to be loaded when loading the mconfig.

    Parse EventTrigger AVP in CCA-U in the FeG
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    Besides RAR, CCU-A is the other message which might have `EventTrigger` and `RevalidationTime` AVPs. This change makes `session_proxy` able to process those two AVPs in CCU-A message and send the event triggers and revalidation time to Gateway through the proto message.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Modify the structure of CCU-A message
    2. Call the function which could process those fields
    
    **Result**
    1. `session_proxy` is able to process `EventTrigger` and `RevalidationTime` AVPs inside CCU-A
    2. The parsing of messages without those AVPs should remain the same

    Remove protobuf registry from magmad
    
    Summary:
    Magmad, the service responsible for receiving and persisting desired configuration from the Orchestrator cloud, previously contained a global protobuf registry to track all of the protobuf message types used for every service.
    
    In order to independently containerize each service and reduce overall memory usage, this global registry has been removed. Each service is now required to pass in the protobuf structure of the message that it uses within Magmad upon instantiation.
    
    Messages are unpacked into this given protobuf structure when the managed configurations are loaded within Magmad.

    Multiplex writes into config into configurator
    
    Summary:
    Multiplexing obsidian config writes into configurator.
    The logic cases on the format of config type to see whether to treat it as a network config or  an entity config. (if the type is prefixed by "network_", it's treated as a network config. Otherwise, it is treated as an entity config)
    
    Additionally, since the configurator and config DBs have not been synched up, when multiplexing a config write into a network/entity that does not yet exist in the configurator DB, it will create a placeholder network/entity that only has the necessary information.

    Multiplex magmad gateway write into device and configurator (#306)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/306
    
    Add logic for multiplexing gateway related magmad writes into configurator.
    The multiplex happens on the obsidian handlers level so that it is easier to turn off the magmad writes later on.
    Since configurator/device DBs and magmad DBs are not yet synched up, if a gateway is not already registered in configurator/device when update is called, it will fetch the necessary information (physicalID) from magmad and create a gateway with the update patched on.

    # S11
    The S11 task in OAI is used to communicate with the SGW. However, since moving to embedded SGW, we no longer use this functionality. Let's remove it.
    
    # OAI_SGW
    We will no longer be supporting separate SGW (hasn't been tested for a long time -- probably doesn't work in its current state). Let's remove the build target from the codebase.

    Parse EventTrigger AVP in RAR in the FeG
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    The Revalidation Timer feature is not implemented yet. Some RAR messages coming from PCRF (gx) will have the `EventTrigger` AVP with the value `REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT`. In this case, the gateway is required to send a Credit Control Update Request message after the timer expires.
    This diff implements the necessary functionality in FeG side (session_proxy).
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Add `EventTrigger` and `RevalidationTime` to the structure of RAR message
    2. Modify the proto message conversion function `ToProto` to populate those fields in the proto mesage
    
    **What's affected**
    1. session_proxy in FeG is now able to parse RevalidationTime AVP from RAR message
    2. Nothing should happen in gateway side as the logic in sessiond is not implemented yet

    Add missing AVP: Revalidation-Time
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    To support the revalidation timer feature, the `session_proxy` needs to be able to parse `Event-Trigger` and `Revalidation-Time` AVPs coming from CCA-U or RAR. Currently, the `Revalidation-Time` AVP is missed in AVP codes is Go-Diam.
    Also, some wrong indentations are fixed.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Add the AVP in `gx_credit_control.xml` based on 3gpp 29.212
    2. Run `autogen.sh` to generate required changes
    
    **Result**
    1. Gx Diameter messages (CCA-U and RAR) with the `Revalidation-Time` AVP could be parsed by session_proxy.
    2. Parsing of other messages should not be affected.

    Remove parenthesis from SQL queries in cases where there is only one parameter and fix indexing bug
    
    Summary:
    A couple of fixes to issues I've come across with storage/sql.go
    
    When performing updateNetwork operations I was getting this error:
    ` ERROR:  source for a multiple-column UPDATE item must be a sub-SELECT or ROW() expression at character 38`
    `STATEMENT:  UPDATE cfg_networks SET (version) = (cfg_networks.version + 1) WHERE cfg_networks.id = $1`.
    This apparently is due to the parenthesis in cases that only have one thing inside.
    
    There was also an issue where the parameter numbers, "$1" etc, were off by one.

    Add services to expose legacy 443 ports for clientcert and open on proxy
    
    Summary: - For back-compat with existing gateways, we need to expose 9443/9444 on proxy as 443, so spin up 2 new services in the helm chart to do that.

    Convert all prometheus metrics to gauges (#299)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/299
    
    This is another issue that prometheus causes that we have to work around to make it work for our case. The following situation would cause a scrape to fail:
    * NetworkA provides metric `metricA` as type `GAUGE`
    * NetworkB provides metric `metricA` as type `COUNTER`
    * This is possible since we can't expect different networks to follow identical metric naming/type protocols
    * If these both made it into the final scrape text exposition, the scrape would fail since there are identical metrics of different types
    * To solve this, we simply convert all metrics into gauges before prometheus does it internally
      * A gauge is a gauge, and a counter just switches types
      * A histogram is converted into 3 gauge families `<basename>_bucket`, `<basename>_sum`, `<basename>_count`, where `{le=xxx}` labels are added to the buckets
      * A summary is converted into 3 gauge families `<basename>`, `<basename>_sum`, `<basename>_count`, where `{quantile=xxx}` labels are added to the basename metric
    * Since all conversions are well-defined, we lose no functionality in the end since prometheus would have done exactly this internally.
    * Metrics from different networks are still segmented using a networkID label

    Implement Northbound Configurator servicers (Load, CreateAndUpdate for Network/NetworkEntity) (#297)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/297
    
    This diff implements the northbound portion of servicer functions defined in D15091643 .
    The major chunk of this diff (configurator_helper.go) is the translation between the protobuf structs used for grpc and the structs used for storage.
    
    As mentioned in https://fb.quip.com/SDsNADhTn7wj, the northbound servicers are meant for user interaction with the service. So an upcoming diff will implement the REST API portion that uses these client_api functions also defined in this diff.
    
    Validations for the values passed in will come soon.
    
    Delete functions will come in the next diff.

    Create Carrier WiFi Access Gateway
    
    Summary:
    This diff serves to begin the implementation of
    the CWAG (Carrier WiFi Access Gateway) by establishing a
    VM running Ubuntu 18.04 with OVS v2.8.1 installed in it.
    The ansible playbook also installs docker and docker-compose.
    Currently no developer tools / magma related setup is included.
    Most of what is needed will included within the Docker images. It
    is still an open question to me whether we should install Golang
    during provisioning.
    
    Long term, we should still explore the possibility of
    running OVS as a docker container which would allow us
    to remove Vagrant in our dev environment. For now though,
    this gives our team a working environment for development.

    * Multi-tenancy support is provided by attaching the networkID to each receiver name, so receivers can then be retrieved per network.

    Add northbound, southbound, and internal proto type definitions for configurator (#286)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/286
    
    Here are the proto definitions for the configurator service. Implementations to come.
    
    I've split the service into 3 servicers (northbound, southbound, internal). So that we can limit the type of functions device/user has access to.  The northbound (will be used by the REST API) servicer specifies allow read/writes into the db, while the southbound (called from the devices) can read the configs set with the nb servicer functions. etc.

    Change checkind obsidian handler to read from state service (#280)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/280
    
    Checkind REST GET API handler now reads from state service storage, instead of the checkind service.
    The implementation is extremely similar to the state service handler to get gateway status, since it is essentially doing the same thing.
    One difference is that since the checkind REST API queries the gateway by its logical gateway id and the states are stored by physical ID, an extra query to magmad is made to translate the ID.

    The problem is the `fabfile.py` putting an empty hash after the `-h` option `./release/build-magma.sh -h  -t Debug --cert $MAGMA_ROOT/.cache/test_certs/rootCA.pem --proxy $MAGMA_ROOT/lte/gateway/configs/control_proxy.yml`.
    Instead, the command should look like `./release/build-magma.sh -h "" -t Debug --cert $MAGMA_ROOT/.cache/test_certs/rootCA.pem --proxy $MAGMA_ROOT/lte/gateway/configs/control_proxy.yml`
    
    **Implementation**
    Add `""` around the hash variable.
    
    **Result**
    Now user could follow the instruction to build a gateway package.

    Relabel connected components when entity update or deletion partitions a graph (#258)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/258
    
    - Edge/node deletion on a graph could create partitions
    - Since we label all connected graph components with the same ID in order to facilitate loading, if a graph is partitioned we need to relabel all the new components
    - This is done by loading the (possibly disconnected) graph entirely from the DB before computing all connected components and relabeling components if necessary. The largest component in the partitioned graph does not change its graph ID.

    Adjust MME name encoding approach according to hcore requirement (#251)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/251
    
    **Summary**
    H-core MSC uses a MME name format that is different from the format used by TeraVM.
    TeraVM does not want the `.` in MME name while H-core MSC needs the `.`.
    Also, H-core MSC needs `0x00` as the ending character.
    In the future, we plan to construct MME name completely in FeG instead of getting the information from Access Gateway.
    
    **Implementation**
    - Change the MME name encoding function in FeG
    
    **What is affected**
    TeraVM combine attach will fail.
    We need to try to modify the test to use this new format for MME name.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/241
    
    **Summary**
    Allow user to specify the IP/port to be used to establish the SCTP connection with MSC/VLR. This is a required feature because MSC/VLR or routers might only allow traffic coming from specific address.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Get the address from environment variable
    
    **What is affected**
    1. Some CSFB unit tests that establish SCTP connection are updated and should still pass.
    2. User can now specify address to use in `/var/opt/magma/envdir/`. If a wrong address is specified there, CSFB service would not be able to establish SCTP connection with the MSC/VLR

    Moving to the shared webpack introduces a number of advantages:
    
    * Faster builds - the prod build now runs as fast as the dev build used to
    * Vendor bundle - libraries like react are extracted into a separate bundle from application code. This improves caching
    * Hashed bundles - improves caching

    Add support for eNB configuration
    
    Summary:
    Prior to this, configuration for an eNodeB is associated directly to a Magma access gateway. In order to support multiple eNodeB's per AGw, we need the ability to configure multiple eNodeB's separately for AGw.
    
    The plan here is to be able add eNodeB configuration to a network, with the key being the eNodeB serial ID, which has been found to be a unique identifier of the hardware in question. A separate tab is added for eNodeB configs. Then it should be possible to move the eNB between AGw's.
    
    To associate the eNB to the AGw, LTE->RAN configs will have a section for associating eNBs by serial ID to the AGw. Associating the eNB to the AGw is useful because then we can detect if the eNB is unexpectedly disconnected/powered-off, otherwise we wouldn't know if there's supposed to be 2 or 3 eNB's attached to the AGw.
    
    Since the eNodeB configuration has redundant fields vs. the other configuration, the plan is to have a transition period where the old config format is deprecated.
    
    This revision adds the ability to create/read/update/delete eNodeB configuration for a network, but not yet the ability to associate it an AGw.

    Implement Deregister GRPC method for SWx Proxy (#274)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/274
    
    This diff serves to implement the Deregister method for swx_proxy. When a user is
    authenticated with an HSS, the AAA server sends a registration request to the HSS that
    links the user to the AAA server. If the AAA server ever needs to remove that user,
    it should send a USER_DEREGISTRATION SAR request to the HSS. This diff implements
    that functionality. While it is unclear what the exact use-case will be for this method,
    we will need it at some point in the future.

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/262
    
    As part of the effort to make MME stateless, we need a way to preserve state across MME restarts for each subcomponent. This includes SCTP. Unfortunately, the kernel doesn't offer any facility to keep an SCTP socket alive across process restarts. Therefore, we are factoring out MME SCTP facilities into a separate, more stable service, `sctpd`.
    
    This diff adds the protobuf specification for MME <-> sctpd communication.

    Add a gatewaystatus REST API endpoint for state (#261)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/261
    
    Added a REST endpoint to get gateway state from the state service.
    When the GET request is made, the handler reads from the state storage and returns a serialized GatewayStatus. The result is identical to what the checkind service returns.
    
    In order to get this to work, I had to copy over the swagger model for gateway status from checkind. The other option was to have the model defined higher up in scope, which seemed like a bit of an overkill, so I will leave it like this for now.

    Add certificate epiry and timestamp to saved states to support backward compatibility for GatewayStatus (#256)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/256
    
    The motivation for this change is to support backwards compatibility for when state service replaces checkind service. Right now, the checkind API provides two extra fields (time at which the state was received and certificate expiry date) that are added onto CheckinRequest struct to create GatewayStatus.
    
    The state service will now save those two info for every state that it retrieves.

    Improve test result loading performance
    
    Summary:
    Whenever the results of a test execution are loaded, all columns were being loaded as well. For large networks, this caused huge responses (10s of megabytes). This loads only the columns required to display the link results table. Once a link result is selected, then we load all the columns. Also this completely filters out the iperf blobs as they were the largest contributors to size.
    
    This also adds some api contract tests

    new pushgateway
    
    Summary:
    This provides a new "pushgateway" for the magma controller to push to, which prometheus can scrape.
    * This more closely resembles carbon-cache from graphite, as it can queue metrics for scraping so multiple datapoints for each series can be held in the cache.
    * This was previoulsy impossible with the prometheus pushgateway
    * This cache uses a fixed-size queue for each metric series so that metrics can't keep building up forever.
    * During a scrape:
      * The oldest datapoint (by time received) for each metric series will be popped from the queue and converted into a text exposition format for prometheus to scrape.
      * If all metric series in a family have 0 size, the family is removed from memory to avoid holding onto metrics forever
    * Remove all references to the original prometheus pushgateway since that will never work

    Clean up UE context after UE context release command (#257)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/257
    
    This change fixes the issue reported in
    https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/issues/96.
    
    After sending the UE context release command, the S1AP task waits for UE context
    release complete message from eNodeB to clean up UE context in S1AP. In some
    scenarios, the eNodeB might initiate a Service Request before it sends out the
    UE context release complete. The MME processes the Service request and changes
    the UE S1AP state to waiting for context "setup" response. When the MME receives
    the UE context release complete it fails the assertion that UE must be waiting for context
    "release" response. This causes a crash.
    
    This change fixes this issue by:
    1. Removing the assertion causing the crash
    2. Releasing the UE context right after sending the UE context release command
    3. Removing the UE context release guard timer and just logging receipt of UE
    context release complete

    Changing the type of state sent from gateway to use a named tuple. This way, we can send the states as a JSON that can easily be decoded into the swagger generated GatewayStatus struct.
    I've duplicated a lot of the code here that constructs the checkin request to make this happen. After we fully migrate checkind state reporting/reading to use the state service, we can remove much of the old code.

    Unify dev and production docker environments
    
    Summary:
    This diff serves to create more similiar environments between our docker dev and prod environments.
    Rather than using one container with all services in dev and one container per service in prod, we will instead
    use one container per service in dev. The only difference between environments now are the two extra containers
    defined in `docker-compose.override.yml` which define a test container and the HSS-Lite container (for testing).
    
    The test container will be used to run any unit tests, quickly build to test for compilation errors, and run
    CLIs or other runtime test. The actual services are each run in their own container as opposed to the systemd
    approach. This diff also adds a new magmad.yml file to set the magmad init_system to docker. It also sets up
    the necessary env variables to allow dev/prod images to be built based off of the current environment.
    
    Note: By default `docker-compose build` or `docker-compose up -d` will use both `docker-compose.yml` and
    `docker-compose.override.yml` to create the containers. Thus -f doesn't need to be specified.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/235
    
    * Now that graphite queries can be parsed, we can traverse the tree to find all SeriesLists and restrict them
      * The restriction is done by replacing the seriesList with: `seriesByTag('name=~^metric_name$','networkID=<network>')`
      * More information about the `seriesByTag` function can be found here: https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/functions.html#graphite.render.functions.seriesByTag
    
      * This will allow both simple querying like was available before as well as the full functionality that graphite provides, including functions and composition of functions.
      * One more diff later will fill out the `graphite_functions.go` file with all of the graphite functions we want to support.

    Implement CreateEntity storage method on SQL (#242)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/242
    
    - When you create an entity, if it's associated to more than 1 other graph, all those linked graphs need to become the same graph. This is done as a last step in the creation process.
    - CreateEntities becomes CreateEntity because graph merging gets really complicated when you're creating more than one entity at a time. Since storage operations are done in the context of a transaction, it's all semantically the same. We can batch calls in the service layer instead.

    * add tests for the new, more complex isAuthorized logic
    
    Here's my notes on how the permissions specification works
    * if a user has any of the required roles, they are authorized
    * - Structure is TG_<category>_<read | write> - all uppercase
    * - Write implies read
    * - ALL_X can be substituded in place of any category's read or write role - IE:
    *    isAuthorized({roles:['TG_ALL_WRITE']}, ['TOPOLOGY_WRITE']) => true
    *    isAuthorized({roles:['TG_ALL_WRITE']}, ['TOPOLOGY_READ']) => true
    * - ALL_WRITE is essentially full admin privileges

    - Added a snapshot verifier context which is used to capture the snapshot of the flows right after the test packets are sent, before the policy is disabled

    Add logic to periodically collect operational states from gateway services (#167)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/167
    
    A new service303 function GetOperationalStates was added in D14738655. A new script in magmad, state_reporter, will query each state for its operational states, aggregate them, and send them off to the state service. Since the operational states can look different for every device, it is encoded as a JSON.
    
    Each service can register a callback function to write in the state when GetOperationalStates is called by the state_reporter. The default in every service is None. This is the same model that the service_poller uses.
    
    Additionally, the reporter will also take the latest checkin request sent as a state and report it.

    Configuration will prioritize per-eNB configuration for multiple eNB configuration (#231)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/231
    
    This revision adds support on the Magma gateway to consume a gateway.mconfig which includes configuration per-eNodeB, and will let the enodebd service configure each eNodeB differently. Because users of Magma will need to migrate to the new per-eNB configuration, enodebd will prioritize the new per-eNB configuration over the old per-gateway configuration, but supports both.

    Add state machine manager (#223)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/223
    
    This revision is an intermediate step for adding support of multiple eNodeB devices connected to, and configured by, a single Magma gateway.
    
    The StateMachineManager manages multiple state machines. Each state machine is responsible for handling a single eNB, tracked by its serial-id (unique to each eNB), and subsequently by its IPv4, because it will not report its serial-id in each TR-069 message.
    
    ~~This revision only adds the StateMachineManager class and unit tests for it, but does not integrate it into the function of the enodebd service.~~

    Make StatsManager into an observer of the state machine (#222)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/222
    
    This revision reverses the relationship between the state machine and StatsManager.
    
    Instead of the state machine (henceforth called the 'handler') being responsible for clearing stats on the StatsManager whenever the eNodeB stops transmitting, the StatsManager will keep a reference to the handler.
    
    The StatsManager will indirectly observe the state of the eNodeB through the handler. When it detects that that the eNodeB has stopped transmitting, then stats will be cleared.
    
    This change is useful for two reasons:
    1) This reorganizes dependencies into a stricter hierarchy, and avoids circular dependencies later on.
    2) The StatsManager and the handler/state-machine have a better separation of responsibility.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/218
    
    This allows subscribers to be configured for the HSS lite using swagger. This makes test setup easier so that scripts or the HSS subscriber CLI are not needed to populate subscribers. Subscriber streaming is implemented by adding a new listener which waits for updates from the subscriberdb cloud service and then updates the hss subscriber store accordingly. This feature can be enabled/disabled via swagger.

    Summary:
    This revision makes several changes to aid in debugging of enodebd and eNB behavior.
    
    Unhandled errors in the state machine will trigger a state transition to an error state, so that the same errors are not raised repeatedly, and the logs only contain the relevant errors.
    
    While the error is caught, the ```traceback``` module is used to dump the stacktrace out to error logs.
    
    Finally, some debugging info will be dumped into error logs, of the device and desired configuration.

    Looking at https://bugs.python.org/issue27682
    
    The stacktrace matches well, and there's a comment:
    > This error is a protocol error.  It is the analog to WSAECONNRESET.
    ECONNRESET occurs when the local host receives a RST packet from the peer, usually because the peer closed the connection.
    WSAECONNABORT occurs when the local tcp layer decides that the connection is dead, (it may have sent RST to the peer itself).  This can occur for various reasons.  Often because the client has cone away, closed the connection or other things.  It is best to treat WSACONNRESET as WSACONNABORT, i.e., there was a TCP protocol error and the transaction (http request) probably wasn't completed completely by both parties.
    
    Because of this, there's reason to suspect that the eNodeB may occasionally close a TCP connection prematurely, and that we need to handle this.
    This revision ignores dropped TCP connections, and enodebd will continue running as usual. The dropped TCP connection will be logged though, in case we discover later that there is a way to avoid it.

    Add servicers for the state service (#151)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/151
    
    This is a new state service that will manage states of services in the gateway, and is being created as part of the new orc8r reorganization. It uses `orc8r/cloud/blobstorage` interface to store states reported from services.
    The state service has 3 functionalities: `GetStates`, `ReportStates`, and `DeleteStates`.
    
    This diff implements a few things: servicer, test_service and main service.
    `servicer*`: Interacts with the storage interface to do the core work of storing/retrieving these states.
    `test_service_init.go`: Service that can be used for testing on top of an in-memory storage implementation.
    `main.go`: Starts the state service.
    
     I moved a function that fetches networkID from a context defined in eps_authentication to identity_helper.go in orc8r/cloud/go/protos. Since ReportStates does not take in a networkID, this function is useful.
    
    Next step: This state will gather states from different states.

    Summary:

    This should be reusable for orc8r, feg and the pkg repo.
    
    I'll change fab package to build a codedeploy zip file with a specific
    version in the 'image_version' file and then we can use codedeploy to
    deploy a specific version to staging or prod.
    
    Also, this is backward compatible with the old packaging, and so
    we can redeploy the old package to go back.

    Fix race conditions
    
    Summary:
    There are three race conditions which this diff corrects.
    
    1) The in memory storage of the HSS lite could be accessed in parallel by multiple requests leading to data corruption. This was fixed by adding a reader writer lock to ensure that subscriber data can only be modified by one thread.
    
    2) When using sqlite3 with in memory storage, each time a new connection to the database was established, a new database was being connected to. Now, the sql driver will only allow one connection to the database when using an in memory store.
    
    3) When the mock client attempts to connect to the HSS during integration tests, the HSS had to race to bind to a port before the client tried to connect to it. This change switches a fixed timeout to a go channel which will be used to signal when the port has been set.

    Add wrapper function around sql.Open
    
    Summary: There is a race condition if an in memory sqlite3 database allows multiple open connections. Since each connection could create its own private database, then each thread can get a different view of the database. To work around this, sql.Open will be wrapped to check for this case and only allow one open connection for in memory sqlite3 databases.

    Update graphite-web database to MySQL (#197)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/197
    
    The default setup for graphite-web uses SQLite as the database for tags. This works for staging scale, but on prod we have too many metrics and the database is locked constantly, making it impossible to query.

    Make graphite attempt to reconnect after error submitting metric (#198)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/198
    
    If the carbon daemon is stopped on the metrics instance, the connection will be closed and metricsd would need to be restarted to get the connection again. This just tells the exporter that the connection is closed once an error occurs. Then on the next export it will try to reconnect before exporting.

    Using get_all_objects_to_add to get the list of objects to add results in a Fault if the objects don't exist. Right now, we are using this for getting the PLMN list. On Cavium, this list is initially empty. Instead, we get the parent PLMN List object which will include all the children if they exist.
    
    Adding CaviumWaitGetObjectParametersState which does nothing but cleans up the constructor since we always have to disable admin state before trying to change the configs.

    Cavium Admin Enable/Disable state
    
    Summary:
    In the Cavium device, before we can write any configs, we have to set AdminState to disable. After we are done, we should set it to enable to allow the eNB to start transmitting.
    This change extends the relevant classes to support the enabling the admin state.
    This adds a check to see if we need to actually apply configurations before disabling AdminState and bringing down the cell. Also checks that we are allowed to enable the cell from mconfig before re-enabling. Includes relevant state transitions.

    Support server-streaming within Sync RPC (#139)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/139
    
    This diff updates Sync RPC to support server-streaming. This requires some changes to the Sync RPC protobuf, sync rpc client, proxy client, and dispatcher.
    
    The dispatcher HTTP server has been updated to support multiple responses by wrappping the `select` statement in `rootHandler` with a loop. It only returns upon timeout or when `Grpc-Status` is seen in the Trailer. In addition, when the request context is done, a message is sent down to the gateway to let the proxy client know to stop receiving frames for this particular request ID.
    
    The Sync RPC client maintains a table that maps request IDs to bools that dictates whether the connection for this particular request ID is closed.
    
    The proxy client now sends responses frame by frame rather than waiting for all frames. When there are no more frames to receive the proxy client returns.
    
    `sync_rpc_service`.proto has been updated with new fields `keepConnActive` and `connClosed`:
    ```
    message GatewayResponse {
        ...
        bool keepConnActive = 5;
    }
    
    message SyncRPCRequest {
        ...
        bool connClosed = 4;
    }
    ```
    `keepConnActive` is used by the proxy client to tell the cloud client that the connection is still alive.
    `connClosed` is sent from the cloud to the gateway to signify that the proxy client should stop reading frames.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/183
    
    Implements the GET handler for graphite query requests. This will allow the switch from prometheus to graphite as metrics will be received in the database and are now accessible to users. Basic multi-tenant support is in place by validating networkID and wrapping the query in a function that restricts by this tag.
    Also moves common functionality between prometheus and graphite handlers into own util package.

    Refactoring service_poller logic to use Job interface / async model (#152)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/152
    
    Small refactoring to make the code a little bit easier to read. It now implements a Job interface defined in D14006075. So instead of implementing the loop logic in service_poller, it now only implements the work it needs to do and a loop interval, and relies on the Job interface to periodically execute the work.

    Flow type Models
    
    Summary:
    Add flow types to our models. It's a bit hacky because the types are defined in both sequelize and in flow types, and they need to stay in sync. We could potentially write something to parse it, but it's a big project. If someone adds something without adding types, they'll get flow errors.
    If someone deletes something without changing the types, they'll get runtime errors. We can write a test to enforce that the types are correct, but I will look into using ES6 classes with sequelize.
    Also had to modify the sequelize flow types - findOne and create return an instance with the types on them. I believe that the correct way to use the library is to use the `.get(...)` function as opposed to directly accessing the variables, but I don't want to change a ton of code. Open to alternatives.
    
    **I'm looking for comments on how this is implemented.** Maybe we keep the code fixes and don't go this route? Maybe something else?
    
    Having done this, I have uncovered a number of issues:
    - verificationType is undefined in the model but used otherwise.
    - role vs superUser uses in scripts was incorrect

    Add better boolean parsing to mme_config.c
    
    Summary:
    Right now, our boolean parsing:
    a) is repeated/copy-pasted to every boolean field
    b) counts "yes" as true and all else as false
    
    This is bad especially bad because our .yml -> .conf generator outputs "True" and "False" for boolean values which will both be counted as false.
    
    Lets factor out the boolean parsing to a function and make it more robust (handle more t/f values and fatal on unknown values).

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/92
    
    memoryBlobStorage implements TransactionalBlobStorage D14498325 with in-memory storage.
    Usage should look something like this:
    ```
    factory = NewMemoryBlobStorageFactory()
    storage = factory.StartTransaction()
    storage.CreateOrUpdate()
    storage.Delete()
    storage.Commit()/storage.Rollback()
    ```
    Since the in-memory storage is stored as a global variable, each process has its own storage.
    This can later be used in test services to test the new state service that's coming in the orc8r reorganization.
    
    orc8r/blobstore/storage/memory_test.go tests the implementation.

    Make ODS sample submission lock only once (#166)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/166
    
    - Previous implementation ODS export would acquire and release the lock for the queue once for every sample being submitted
    - This could get us into a situation where many goroutines from gateway RPC calls are trying to submit metrics and high-frequency lock contention results in a round-robin between the different goroutines, keeping each goroutine and its local data alive for a long time.
    - This can result in a sort of cascading failure as more goroutines pile up and lock contention increases, increasing memory pressure and ultimately bricking the controller

    - For all exporters, acquire the lock only once for each call to Submit. This means that each grpc request goroutine will clear submit all of its metrics upon lock acquisition to mediate the above scenario

    Add snapshot testing support for pipelined tests
    
    Summary:
    **Background:**
    Currently, when writing unit tests for pipelined, we rely on sending a flow stats request to OVS to check the presence of a flow. This approach has 2 issues:
    - Actions cannot be verified as it is not included in the reply
    - Forgetting a match field in the query will usually still return the correct flow, making it easy to leave out fields when verifying the flows
    
    In general, it is hard to write unit tests to catch changes and regressions in the flows installed by pipelined.
    
    **Implementation**
    This diff introduces snapshot testing to test installed flows by pipelined. The snapshots are annotated flow dumps from OVS without non-deterministic fields such as `duration` and `idle_age`. They will be saved as files inside `tests/snapshots`.
    
    In tests, `assert_bridge_snapshot_match` can be used to assert that the flow installed in the test is unchanged from existing snapshots. If a mismatch occurs, the test will fail with the diff in snapshots and the new snapshot.
    
    We will check in the snapshots into source control, so it will be clear to track any changes and side effects to flow installation.

    Add CLI command to parse & print annotated flow dump
    
    Summary:
    This diff makes several improvements to `pipelined_cli`. The goal is to make pipelined debugging and development easier by providing a combined view of OVS state and Pipelined state.
    
    - Split `enforcement display_flows` into 3 commands:
      - `debug display_flows` prints flow dump with annotation, can be filtered with `--apps` option
      - `debug display_raw_flows` prints the same flow dump as `ovs-ofctl dump-flows gtp_br0`
      - `enforcement display_flows` prints only the flow dump for enforcement apps
    - Flow dump from ovs can be parsed and annotated. Currently we translate table numbers to the pipelined apps and decode the note. In the future, this can be expanded to also translate the registers
    - Flows can be filtered based on apps rather than just table number. This is useful since with the introduction of scratch tables, it is possible for an app to use multiple tables

    Dockerize FeG
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    
    This change enables running the FeG using docker instead of using vagrant and ansible. The FeG can be run either for development or for production. In development mode, all FeG services are run in a single docker container. This allows for a very similar development workflow compared to using a VM. In production mode, each FeG service is run in its own container and docker is used for service management. The production containers have been optimized for size to ease deployment and improve isolation.
    
    **Implementation**
    
    Two new docker files were created and stored in `feg/gateway/build`. They are for go and python. Then, a docker-compose file was made for the development setup and the production setup. This stores all the details needed to create docker containers out of the go and python images. In production, the magmad container mounts the docker socket and a docker init system option was added to magmad's service manager. This allows docker to manage the services instead of requiring systemd to be used.

    Asynchronously terminate session for subscriber
    
    Summary:
    **Background:**
    The initial implementation of PCEF simplified the flow deletion process by terminating the session immediately upon receiving an EndSession request. This resulted in under-reporting of flow usage stats, because pipelined polls flow stats periodically and any usage between the last poll and the time of termination is lost.
    
    D14116606 modifies pipelined to schedule deletion after the last usage us reported, thus fixing the under-reporting problem for the service. However, currently, sessiond still terminates the session immediately. As a result, when pipelined reports the last usage for the session, the usage is ignored since the session no longer exists in sessiond.
    
    **Implementation:**
    This diff modifies sessiond to terminate the session asynchronously, so it will wait for the last report from pipelined. With this diff, the entire under-reporting problem will be solved on a system level.
    
    We introduce additional states for a session to manage its lifecycle:
    ```
      /**
       * State transitions of a session:
       * SESSION_ACTIVE
       *       |
       *       | (start_termination)
       *       V
       * SESSION_TERMINATING_FLOW_ACTIVE <----------
       *       |                                   | (add_used_credit)
       *       | (new_report)                      |
       *       V                                   |
       * SESSION_TERMINATING_AGGREGATING_STATS -----
       *       |
       *       | (finish_report)
       *       V
       * SESSION_TERMINATING_FLOW_DELETED
       *       |
       *       | (complete_termination)
       *       V
       * SESSION_TERMINATED
       */
    ```
    When an EndSession request is received,  `start_termination` is called to mark the subscriber session to be terminated. sessiond will delay the actual session termination until a usage report that does not contain the subscriber, which means that pipelined has deleted the flow and finished reporting its usage. (Technically speaking, we can terminate the session sooner by implementing an endpoint or modifying the RuleRecord proto to specify that usage reporting is finished, but we can keep it simple for now and just wait for the next report) Once this happens, a request along with the last usage stats is sent to Cloud to terminate the session, and the session is deleted locally.
    
    A force termination timeout is included in the config YAML. In the event that flow deletion fails, the session will be terminated forcefully after the timeout. This is implemented by scheduling a `complete_termination` call in `start_termination`.
    
    See header comments for more details.
    
    **Notable changes**
    - We will not surface termination errors to MME, since termination is done asynchronously now. This is fine since we do not do any error handling in MME anyways right now. If we want to do error handling, then a new endpoint will need to be introduced in MME for sessiond to surface the error.
    - Local termination no longer waits for Cloud to finish. Previous implementation performed local termination after Cloud finishes, no matter whether Cloud termination succeeds or not, so there should be no functional changes. Maintaining the existing behavior would make the code even more complicated as we are making the local termination asynchronous now.

    Flow type express
    
    Summary:
    A lot of our packages actually depend on each other, and this isn't clear. Adding these flow types will clear that up, and enforce more type safety.
    
    **I'm looking for comments on how this is implemented** - with express, it's difficult to type since each time we use a middleware, we modify the request object itself, and this isn't supported by flow. I didn't find a good way that others are doing it in the open source world. Each module has to export the type that it ends with (and import the type it expects as input + a `$Shape` of the output so that it can be written to). We can enforce this with unit tests, but I have not done that yet.
    
    By doing this, we discovered a few typing errors (e.g. strings being used as numbers, error objects being passed as strings, returning objects when nothing is expected)
    
    nit - I also didn't strongly type all the input params for functions since flow can deduce what they are. I'm not against typing them, but it was just easier for me. I can fix that if requested (but we should have a lint rule for that if it's what we want).

    Make s1ap pass state around instead of global
    
    Summary:
    As part of our goal to make MME stateless (can crash/update and come back up without losing enb/ue context), we are making the S1AP task stateless as a POC. To make a C program "stateless", we are going off the idea that only the database state needs to be good at all times -- therefore we let the message/state processing happen as normal except that the state is moved from separate globals into one global state that is committed to the db at the end of processing each message.
    
    In this diff, we change from using global state for s1ap task to passing around the state for each message through function arguments. This approach better reflects the intent of stateless which is that only those that need state should have access to it. This also guarantees that other tasks are not interfering with the s1ap state (unless a ue/enb ref is passed in a message) because the must first call s1ap_state_get before being able to access it.

    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/153
    
    Currently there are multiple lists of services, when the service_registry YAML files should be the only place and everything else should point to the registry. My goal is to get rid of `magma/orc8r/cloud/deploy/files/envdir/CONTROLLER_SERVICES`, which currently lists controller services.
    This is step one in trying to achieve this goal. Right now, not all of the fields in service_registry.yml files are being loaded into the corresponding struct in Go.
    
    ServiceRegistry now reads in the field proxy_aliases which was added back in D14176660, so these can be used to specify different proxy ports.

    Reply CLA with diameter success when IMSI not found
    
    Summary:
    **Summary**
    When the FeG receives CLR with unknown IMSI from HSS, the FeG should reply CLA with diameter success instead of treating this as an error. Our current implementation of FeG reply with an error code because all kinds of failure of delivering messages to gateways were treated in the same way.
    
    **Implementation**
    Add a if statement to distinguish the failure of CLR delivery caused by unknown IMSI.
    
    **Result**
    The test of CLR with unknown IMSI should pass.
    Need to check if there is any corner case affected by this change.

    Report mconfig created at timestamp during checkin
    
    Summary:
    This diff adds the created at timestamp of mconfig to the gateway status during checkin.
    
    In order for this to work, magmad is modified to reload the mconfig file on every streamer update, instead of only when the mconfig is changed. This is because the metadata portion of mconfig (which contains created at timestamp) will change on every update, and we always want to send the latest timestamp. Functionally speaking, there should be no change to the mconfig streaming process. Services will only be restarted when their respective config is changed.

    Data model for gateway status
    
    Summary:
    This diff proposes a new data model to represent the status of the access gateway and adds some additional fields. Information will be categorized into the following 4 messages:
    - ServiceStatus
       - Used for status of each individual services on the gateway. This message is unchanged from before.
    - SystemStatus
      - Used for real time system usage information.
    - PlatformInfo
      - Used for platform and environment information.
    - MachineInfo
      - Used for hardware information.
    
    For later: An `additional_status` field will be added for gateway-specific information. Different gateway types will define their own additional status proto, and it will be serialized into `additional_status` as a `google.protobuf.Any` message.
    
    Please see the proto below for detailed information. Note that we will also be deprecating some existing fields and moving them into the new messages instead.

    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/140
    
    To make cloud subscriberdb easier to use and test, the feature flag for enabling it is moved from mme.yml to the mconfig system. With this change, the cloud subscriberdb can be enabled from swagger and the flag in mme.yml is removed. Now that the full functionality of the eps authentication service is implemented, this is a next step towards productionizing cloud subscriberdb.

    Summary:
    There are now now more eslint errors, only warnings.
    Of the 13 warnings left, only 1 is in inventory, and 1 in nmsx (the rest are in tgnms).
    
    Not sure how to fix the line length in inventory, and the routes.js for magmanms is difficult, so leaving it out for now.

    Initialize subscriber state if it is nil
    
    Summary: Sometimes the subscriber state is nil, which can cause the EPS Authentication service's auth requests to fail. Since resync requests can be used to get the correct sequence number, initializing the sequence number to a default of zero will allow these requests to succeed when the state is nil.

    @flow fbcnms-logging
    
    Summary:
    Fix flow for fbcnms-logging.
    
    This means importing the flow-typed files for morgan and winston.
    This means fixing the stream write callback since it's incorrect (checked flow types and the actual morgan code).
    Adding generic type for winston for flow. This will enable autocomplete when logging.
    Ensuring valid log levels are used in the config. (I couldn't find a way to reuse the allowed types without importing the other packages winston uses, and I didn't want to deal with that). Flow will complain if the types don't match, so it should be fine.

    Fix HSS-Lite resync sqnMS generation
    
    Summary:
    In recent integration testing, it was discovered that the HSS-Lite in testcore doesn't
    resynchronize properly. This is a crucial step for the HSS working with real hardware as we don't
    store the sequence number for a subscriber past runtime. As such, once the sequence number gets high enough
    on the UE, the re-sync sequence would continuously trigger without working. This fix corrects a bug
    with the generation of the sqnms. As such the HSS now successfully resyncs with a UE on startup.

    Summary:
    Add flow to migration scripts.
    
    Flow complains that you need to import as a type instead of using require. However, that is syntactically different. I'm pretty sure sequalize does something weird with how it uses the types, but I don't want to investigate further.
    
    Type annotations are stripped out, however when doing the require, we get an object of string -> object. Thus, I will leave the code as is and tell flow to ignore that one error.

    Add 10m wait for REM after bootup of Baicells, non Qualcomm (#131)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/131
    
    Certain Baicells eNodeB devices cannot be configured during initial REM process following boot-up. This revision adds detection of boot-up via the 'EventCode' of '1 BOOT' received in the TR-069 Inform message. Following this, enodebd will not attempt to configure the Baicells eNodeB for 10 minutes. In addition to this, certain configuration parameters are considered 'invasive', and to successfully apply changes, the device must be rebooted.
    
    Affected devices include:
    - Indoor Baicells eNB Band 40, OUI(48BF74), Version(BaiStation_V100R001C00B110SPC003)
    - Baicells Nova 243 Band43 eNodeB, OUI(48BF74), Version(BaiBS_RTS_3.1.6)

    Reduce WSGIRequestHandler request timeout to 10s from 600s (#129)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/129
    
    The initial Inform message from an eNodeB after bootup causes a broken socket issue with python WSGI server. While the root cause is unknown, reducing the socket timeout solves this issue and allows configuration to proceed.
    
    It's unclear why the timeout was originally 600s.

    Keycloak openid connect, SSR login page, unit tests
    
    Summary:
    * Custom login form (oauth2 password grant)
    * Users stored in keycloak
    * Informative error messages
    * Dynamic openid parameter discovery
    * supports both the openid password flow and the openid authcode flow
    * No breaking changes to application code
    
    New Environment Variables:
    * CLIENT_ROOT_URL
      * full url pointing to the nms
      * example: http://clavelle.sb.facebook.net:8080
    * KEYCLOAK_HTTP_PROXY
      * use this if you're running NMS in an environment where a proxy is required, but that proxy must be different than the lab proxy. This occurs when the openid server is on the public internet, but the controllers are in the lab.
      * I pointed this to fwdproxy on my devserver
    * KEYCLOAK_HOST
      * full url to the openid server
      * example: https://fbckeycloak.alexclavelle.com
    * KEYCLOAK_REALM
      * Nms must be registered as a client in this keycloak realm
    * KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID
      * Pre-registered client id - note that the client must be registered in the KEYCLOAK_REALM - not the master realm.
      * multiple clients can share the same client id as long as they each add their respective hostnames to the client's "Valid Redirect URIs" field
    * KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET
      * you can find this logging into keycloak, going to your realm, selecting your client, and going to the credentials tab
    
    To use this functionality:
    * The keycloak server must be running and accessible from NMS. If you are also using the auth code flow, the server must also be accessible from the user's browser.
    * All environment variables must be set
    * set LOGIN_ENABLED=true environment variable

    This diff enables python service303 services to reload the local config.

This allows logging level config to be applied dynamically without a service restart.
    
    The previous reload callback is removed, as this is not going to be useful for the time being, since log level reloading is handled by service303.

    Fix hashtable_ts_keys to return non-null on empty ht
    
    Summary:
    Currently, the implementation of hashtable_ts_keys is both bugged and not useful.
    - the bug occurs when one calloc fails causing a null pointer dereference
    - the function also returns NULL on both failure and when the hashtable is empty, making its semantics unclear
    
    This diff fixes both of these errors
    - the bug by aborting early on calloc fail (and freeing the previous calloc if the second fails)
    - the semantics by allocating a struct even when the hashtable is empty

    Add pre-configured subscribers on startup to testcore HSS (#116)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/116
    
    Recent testing of the HSS has shown a need to be able to configure subscribers in
    the test HSS on start-up rather than using the hss_cli. Preconfigured subscribers allow a
    repeatable test environment with less variables in play. This diff serves to add subscribers
    that are listed in an `hss.yml` file as the HSS service begins running. These subscribers are
    given a basic profile.
    
    If the need arises in the future to allow for more configurable options, this can easily be added.
    While helpful, the best long term solution would be to stream subscribers from the orc8r, so that
    subscribers are stored state, rather than being added on startup.

    Activate and deactivate flows in one atomic function (#112)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/112
    
    During TerraVM testing, a race condition with flow activation and deactivation was discovered in Pipelined due to the new rule versioning system. This bug happens because version update, enforcement flow activation, and enforcement_stats flow activation are scheduled separately in the run loop. It is possible for the version to be updated again by another rpc call, before the flow is activated in the apps.
    
    Example:
    rpc call to activate flow (update version to 1) --> rpc call to deactivate flow (update version to 2) --> flow install by enforcement apps (flow installed with version = 2)
    
    This diff fixes the issue by refactoring all rule activation/deactivation logic into one atomic function, which is scheduled in the run loop. For activation, the function will perform version update and flow activation for each app without scheduling them in the run loop.

    Differentiate between permanent and transient storage errors (#106)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/106
    
    When the EPS Authentication service fails to lookup a subscriber, then either the subscriber is not in the database, or there was a transient storage error. This changes the `lookupSubscriber` function to differentiate between these two kinds of errors as specified by 3GPP TS 29.272. A transient error indicates to the caller that they can retry the request at a later time whereas a permanent error signals that the request should not be retried.
    
    Also, while adding a unit test, I noticed that in `ul_test.go` there is a typo where the message variable name was `air` instead of `ulr`. I corrected the typo in this change as well.

    Travis has failed many times because a service has been in the `activating` state instead of `active`. Waiting for 20 seconds before checking if the services are active should make this test less flaky (this will give the services more time to start).

    Add feature flag for using the EPS Authentication service
    
    Summary:
    This change adds a feature flag which will allow using the EPS authentication service instead of local subscriber DB or the s6a proxy. Currently, the flag must be manually edited in the `mme.yml` file, but in a future change this will be extended so that it can be set using swagger (like the relay_enabled flag). The logic to decide which service handles authentication requests is as follows:
    
    1) If the relay enabled flag is true, then the S6a Proxy in the FeG will receive the requests
    2) Otherwise, if cloud_subscriberdb_enabled is true, then the EPS authentication service will receive the requests
    3) If neither flag is true, then local subscriber db is used
    
    This feature flag is designed so that when it is false, nothing is changed. This will make deployment of the eps_authentication service easier. After deployment, we plan to cleanup the flags since it is not needed to have two bool flags like this.

    * Auth session state
    * Vendor specific application id
    
    The following AVPS had their Vendor ID fixed:
    * AMBR
    * Service selection
    
    Fixing the service selection AVP required changing the vendor ID in `tgpp_swx.xml` and then running `autogen.sh`.

    Add tests for ReloadServiceConfig in MagmaService (#79)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/79
    
    Ian is working on a command line tool to adjust service configurations
    without requiring a service restart. To support this we need a way for
    each service to accept these requests.
    
    This diff adds unit tests for ReloadServiceConfig in MagmaService.cpp.
    Specifically, it tests that by default MagmaService::ReloadServiceConfig
    returns an unsupported result code. Then, sets the callback to a
    succeeding and failing config change and tests that it receives the
    correct return codes (success/failure). Finally, the callback is cleared
    and we check that it again returns an unsupported result code.

    Ian is working on a command line tool to adjust service configurations

    This diff adds support for registering a custom config reload callback

    calls to the service.

    This diff adds a new config_cli which allows users to modify the log level by changing the override YAML config. This will make it easier to change the log level for a particular service. It also gives a command to get the current log level, since we log level can be defined in the default config and overridden by the override config.
    
    Note that because the cli will load the override YAML file and write the object in memory back as a file, any comments in the override file will be lost.

Moving milenage into the package of the eps_authentication service allows it to be included by both packages (since `lte/cloud` cannot include packages in `feg`).

    Implement generic command framework in gateway (#73)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/73
    
    This diff implements the generic command framework on the gateway side.
    
    When `magmad` starts up, it now looks for the following config in `magmad.yml`. If it exists, the `GenericCommand` RPC call will succeed, otherwise it will return an error.
    ```
    generic_command_config:
      # location of command executor module
      module: ...
      class: ...
    ```
    It looks up the class located in that module and sets it as the command executor. The command executor stores a dictionary that maps names (as strings) to functions to execute. Using the shell command executor, it reads a list of shell commands from the config into its dictionary, creating a subprocess per shell command in the list when ran, as shown below. However, users can choose to create their own modules to extend this functionality (such as running native python).
    ```
    generic_command_config:
      module: magma.magmad.generic_command.shell_command_executor
      class: ShellCommandExecutor
      shell_commands:
        - name: run_something
          command: "/path/to/script/ foo"
        - name: do_something
          command: "/another/command {}"
          allow_params: True
    ```
    The shell command executor is the default command executor. It returns the return code, stdout, and stderr after the command runs. In addition, parameters may be specified if `allow_params` is set to true for that command. It will read the list `param_list` from the parameters dictionary and format the command string with the list of parameters.
    
    When a client calls `GenericCommand`, the servicer in `magmad/rpc_servicer.py` will run the command located in the command executor's table and return the result of that command. If more than `timeout_secs` (default 15) seconds pass while running the command, it is considered a timeout and an error is returned.

    Add generic command method to magmad protobuf (#72)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/72
    
    - Created generic command RPC method in `magmad.proto`
    - Created servicer for generic command method in `magmad/rpc_servicer.py` (currently will return "not implemented")
    - Added generic command method to `magmad_cli.py` for testing purposes, which takes in a command name and json string as parameters
    
    The purpose of this RPC method is to provide a way to run scripts on the gateway without having to create a new RPC method and REST handler per method, instead just defining scripts on the gateway and calling the generic endpoint.

    Multiple Bearer Datapath Support.
    
    Summary:
    Currently downlink traffic is mapped to a bearer (each bearer has a unique GTP tunnel) based on destination IP address.
    With multiple bearers sharing the same IP address of the UE, IP address of the UE can not be used to identify all the bearers.
    Default bearer is identified by the IP of the UE and dedicated bearers are identified based on flow given by the traffic flow template (tft).
    Modified current APIs to send downlink tft and use it to program flows to identify traffic for dedicated bearers  if they are present.

    Properly delete all enforcement_stats flows on subscriber detach (#64)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/64
    
    Currently, the `deactivate_flow` rpc endpoint deleted enforcement_stats flows for a given subscriber + ruld_ids combination by incrementing the current version of these flows, which schedules a deletion. However, it did not handle the other use case of deleting all flows for a subscriber if rule_ids is empty. As a result, these enforcement_stats flows are not deleted, and enforcement_stats continues reporting stats to sessiond, resulting in errors in sessiond's side.
    
    This diff adds a check in the rpc servicer for empty rule_ids. If it is empty, then the version of all flows for the subscriber will be incremented so they will be deleted.
    
    `pipelined_cli` is also updated to test this case. When --rule_ids is not specified, an empty list will be sent to delete all flows, rather than a default list of rules.

    create a serializer/deserializer for state services (#54)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/54
    
    - New 'state' service directory in orc8r/services
    - Defined a new StateSerdes interface
      - This manages different serializer and deserializers for the state service to handle the generic serialization layer between the service and its storage layer.
      - A lot of the logic here mimics ConfigManager.
    - Each module now has GetStateSerdes in its plugin that lists all of the State Ser/De implemented.
    - Implemented a StateSerdesfor CheckinRequest in magmad
    
    The ultimate goal is to be able to read state reported from 'Network Entities,' checkin status, subscriber info for mobility, etc.

    This change makes enodebd end provisioning sessions quickly after checking that it was able to configure eNodeB parameters successfully. Previously, enodebd would not end provisioning sessions, and continuously send GetParameterRequest messages to poll for MME connection, and some other parameter values.
    
    Now, enodebd will wait for subsequent Inform messages from the eNodeB to poll for information on MME connection via GetParameterRequest.

    Create SWx CLI for debugging and testing (#55)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/55
    
    With the recent creation of the SWx service, we now have a service that can translate gRPC into
    SWx protocol over diameter. For upcoming integration and deployments, having a tool to easily send requests
    to the service will be useful both for verifying service correctness and connectivity with the HSS.
    
    This CLI's main functionality is to send MAR diameter message to the HSS and receive back an MAA. This can be
    done either through an existing SWx service that is running, or using a built-in proxy service that is a part
    of this CLI. This allows us to test both if our local service is configured correctly  as well as test HSS connectivity
    before this service is deployed.
    
    This CLI achieves its functionality either with the use of flags or by running in 'interactive mode' that
    allows necessary parameters to be entered one by one for a more user friendly experience.

    Add a command in pipelined cli to get table assignments (#52)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/52
    
    With the introduction of service chaining, table assignment is now dynamic and we can no longer simply refer to table X for flows for an app. This makes debugging hard, as the table assignment needs to be figured out from studying the flows in the flow dump.
    
    This diff introduces a new command in `pipelined_cli`, `table_assignment`, which can be used to print a table of table assignments of each app. An optional argument `--apps` can be used to only filter the app assignment of interest.
    
    A method is introduced in service manager to expose the app to table mapping and a new rpc endpoint is added to pipelined to expose this information. We expose the assignment with apps instead of services since this command is meant for internal debugging, and it is extra work to get the app -> service reverse mapping.

    Attach Request Codec_list IE decode failure
    
    Summary:
    ***Issue -  Decode failed of optional codec_list IE within Attach Request Message***
    ***Impact - Attach failure.***
    
    **Background and Context**
    * In original code decode for only one codec was supported (GERAN). This resulted in attach failure for the UEs that support SRVCC to GERAN and UTRAN and send codec information for GERAN and UTRAN. Sometime last year decode support for optional codec_list IE for both GERAN and UTRAN was added.
    * This functionality got broken recently when we pulled/merged some code clean-up related changes from OAI git. This happened EITHER  due to using function definition of decode_supported_codec_list()  from file c/oai/tasks/nas/ies/SupportedCodecList.c instead of using it from c/oai/lib/3gpp/3gpp_24.008_cc_ies.c OR due to passing incorrect 2nd parameter to function decode_supported_codec_list().
    This fix correct 2nd aspects. However we can fix 1st aspect as well.
    * This issue resulted in attach failure of UEs that supports SRVCC to GERAN and/or UTRAN and hence sends optional codec_list IE.
    * However for the following UEs attach works fine ( with this broken functionality) :
        *  UEs that don' support SRVCC and hence don't send optional codec_list IE in attach request. Such UEs are rare nowadays .
       *   UEs that sends optional "MS Class Mark 3" also together with optional codec_list IE in attach request. Current implementation skips decoding of remaining optional IEs if MS Class Mark 3 is present ( which itself is a bug in the code) and this hides this issue.
    
    NOTE: There are 2 following solutions to fix this issue. This diff has used option 2.
    
    Option 1. Use function definition of decode_supported_codec_list()  from file c/oai/lib/3gpp/3gpp_24.008_cc_ies.c  instead of using it from c/oai/tasks/nas/ies/SupportedCodecList.c
    
    OR
    
    Option 2. Pass correct 2nd parameter to function decode_supported_codec_list() which is defined in c/oai/tasks/nas/ies/SupportedCodecList.c
    
    NOTE: Decoding of MS Class Mark 3 will be fixed in separate diff.

    Apply include-what-you-use to help untangle deps
    
    Summary:
    In order to develop stateless MME, it would be helpful to have no intertask dependencies. However, the current state of includes/header files is very intertangled -- making it hard to remove these dependencies.
    
    In this diff, we run the include-what-you-use clang tool over c/oai (along with some manual cleanup). This tool adds includes for each type/function/etc that a .h/.c file pair uses -- in effect collapsing the header dependency tree.

    Implement verify authorization option for swx_proxy authenticate gRPC method (#41)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/41
    
    After sending MAR and receiving back the authentication vectors in an MAA, there is the potential
    that some HSS's will require an authorization step. This step requires sending an SAR (see 3GPP 29.273 8.1.2.2.1) with ServerAssignmentRequest set to AAA_USER_DATA_REQUEST.
    
    When the user profile is received back in an SAA message, the swx_proxy service
    here will verify that the flag Non-3GPP-IP-Access is set to ENABLED (enumerated type 0). If this is the case,
    the Authenticate gRPC method will return the vectors. Otherwise the user is not authorized and will receive
    back an error stating so.

    Failure handling logic is also added to ensure that if the activation fails in one controller, the operation will be reverted in the other controller so we don't end up in inconsistent state. Success will only be reported if flows are installed in both controllers.

    - Fixing the previously disabled `meter_stats` test. I ran the test >20 times so hopefully it is no longer flakey.
    - Adding tests for `subscriber` (and renaming `enforcement` test, for some reason it was called `test_subscriber previously) to test for meter flow deletion with and without meter stats polling enabled.

    Add meter flow deletion scheduling to avoid underreporting usage
    
    Summary:
    **Background**:
    Metering in PipelineD is implemented using 3 controllers: `meter`, `meter_stats`, and `subscriber`.
    - `meter` is responsible for installing flows for each subscriber.
    - `meter_stats` can be configured to poll stats on the flows installed by `meter` and report them to `meteringd`.
    - `subscriber` can be configured to poll the list of subscribers from `mobilityd` and remove metering flows for subscribers that are deleted.
    
    Previously, `subscriber` deletes the flows for deleted subscriber right away, resulting in underreporting of usage stats for the deleted subscriber.
    
    This diff fixes the underreporting issue by delaying the flow deletion until a stats reply event for the metering table is received, which is also used by `meter_stats` to report usage.
    
    Stats reply events are chosen to coordinate flow deletion as this approach does not require introducing additional dependency between `meter_stats` and `subscriber` compared to other approaches such as adding an interface in `subscriber` that `meter_stats` can call to signal that the using is reported. This approach does not guarantee that all usage stats are reported all the time, since `meter_stats` can technically fail to process the stats reply. I think it is acceptable to ensure deletion of flows at the cost of underreporting the usage in these degenerate scenarios.
    
    Note that if polling is off, then the deletion process is unchanged.

    Add Network Access Mode field in the ULA sent to gateway (#30)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/30
    
    **Summary**
    Previously, the `network_access_mode` avp in the S6a ULA message is ignored in s6a_proxy. The field is hard-coded in gateway as `PACKET_ONLY`. This approach works fine for basic combine attach, but, for CSFB combine attach, the `network_access_mode` should be `PACKET_AND_CIRCUIT`.
    
    **Implementation**
    1. Add the `network_access_mode` in the ULA proto message
    2. Modify FeG s6a_proxy codes to populate this field
    3. Modify gateway codes to read `network_access_mode` and populate the corresponding field in the S6a itti message
    
    **Result**
    When reading the S6a itti message converted from proto message, the MME should be able to see the network access mode being set to different values.
    Nothing else should be affected.

    ansible role now reads service_registry from remote /etc/configs/ not from host (#29)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/29
    
    Since prod does not execute modules when provisioning, the service_registry variable (defined in modules) was never defined. This led to proxy failing because proxy relies on that variable.
    
    I created a new role, service_reigstry, so that it can be included when needed.
    I made it so that it'll look up in /etc/magma/configs to see which modules are there and it'll use that information to fetch the service_registry files.

Parsing those out in the prometheus exporter to apply the correct labels will allow us to expose these cloud metrics.

    Resetting of Baicells devices after configuration
    
    Summary: Baicells eNB devices require a reboot for parameter changes to take effect. Specifically, changing of 'invasive' parameters requires a reboot to take effect. This revision changes the Baicells eNB device handlers to reboot the eNB device after setting any parameters. The distinction between 'invasive' and 'non-invasive' parameters is ignored, because reboot time is minimal, and most of the time, provisioning will include the setting of 'invasive' parameters.

    Restructure how unexpected TR069 messages are handled
    
    Summary:
    The state transitions for each eNB device do not take into account that an eNB will send an Inform message at a regular interval even if the device is in the provisioning process. To handle this scenario more gracefully, EnodebAcsState will raise an UnhandledTr069MessageError when an unexpected message type is received, and the state machine will transition to the appropriate state before handling the incoming message.
    
    The state machine will now gracefully handle unexpected Inform and Fault messages. For unexpected Fault messages, the state machine will transition to an error state, instead of flooding logs with repeated exceptions.

    orc8r/controller/.../main.yml and orc8r/proxy/.../main.yml now refers to service_registry instead of headcoding services
    
    Summary:
    To unify references to different service information, orc8r/cloud/deploy/.../controller/.../main.yml and orc8r/cloud/deploy/.../proxy/.../main.yml refer to service_registry.yml files located under {module}/cloud/configs/.
    In order to make this work, I added a field called type to describe where in the architecture the service lies.
    
    The type was derived from how magma/orc8r/cloud/deploy/roles/proxy/vars/main.yml divided the services.
    Services under open_services now has "operator"
    Services under clientcert_services now has "gateway"
    
    I also added services under feg_services into the feg/service_registry and made their type 'proxy' so they can be differentiated.

    Fix FeG mconfig init refresh error (#16)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/pull/16
    
    Currently, when the mconfig init function is called for the Federated Gateway, there's an error
    that the mconfig for a given service is not found. This stems from the ocr8r mconfig protos not having
    been registered before the mconfig init() function is run. This produces an error such as `magma.mconfig.ControlProxy` not found.
    
    This diff adds the orc8r mconfig protos to the import list to ensure that these message types are known before the function triggers.
    Since the protos don't have to be used, they are prefixed with `_`

    Per 3GPP TS 33.102 Appendix C3.4, if a new request comes from the same serving node as the previous request (which will always be the case since we use a FeG), then the index value used for the new request should be the same as the previous request. So, instead of allocating the value cyclically within its range, it should instead be kept as a constant.

    Enable multiple label sets for prometheus exporter
    
    Summary:
    We discovered that we need to remove the host label for metrics being pushed to the pushgateway. Previously the network label names had been hardcoded in. This removes the hardcoding and now allows for more flexible use of network labels through setting the PrometheusExporterConfig.
    * With the pushgateway, we need to remove the host label so we only have 1 time series per metric
    * We want to keep the host label in the directly scraped metrics
    * This will allow different label sets to be used in the future through changes to PrometheusExporterConfig

    Convert auth scheme to a string before storing it in MARs
    
    Summary: The auth scheme was cast directly from an int to a string when a multimedia authentication request (MAR) was proxied from gRPC to diameter. This caused the HSS to see invalid auth schemes in MARs. Instead, now the auth scheme is converted to a string constant before it is stored in the MAR.

    Drop all non-http traffic when a captive portal is enabled.
    
    Summary:
    Openflow doesn't support a "not match" semantic to enable if/else style
    branching. Several solutions can be used to enable this behavior, including
    using a secondary scratch table with 2 flows: one that matches, and the other
    one for the else case.
    
    Here, we can use this model to always drop non-http traffic when a captive
    portal is enabled by making the else case a drop action.

    Update imsi as required in deactivate flow comment in enforcement
    
    Summary:
    This diff updates the comment and arg check logic in deactivate flow to ensure imsi is none.
    
    I tested the function using pipelined cli and if imsi is none, the function would break instead of properly deleting the rule for all subscribers. To properly support the deletion, we would need to update the qos rate limiting to allow deletion of all flows of a rule. The function is currently only used by session manager and there is no use cases for deactivating a rule for all subscirbers, so we can just mention imsi is required for now.

    Summary:
    I want to eventually have fbcode/magma/orc8r/cloud/deploy/roles/controller/tasks/main.yml point to the service_registry files to load the list of service names.

    Majority of the references to this service was already 'feg_relay' so I changed the service_registry reference to be named 'feg_relay'.
    Although, feg_to_gw_realy is a more descriptive name, so I'm open to switching it the other way around as well.

    Add mock handler for SARs
    
    Summary: This change adds a mock handler for server assignment requests (SARs) to the HSS. Currently, the handler just verifies that all the mandatory AVPs are present, and if so, gives a mock response.

    Add mock handler for MARs
    
    Summary: This change adds a mock handler for multimedia authentication requests (MARs) to the HSS. Currently, the handler just verifies that all the mandatory AVPs are present, and if so, gives a mock response without any authentication data.

    Refactor message handling to remove code duplication
    
    Summary: When the HSS receives a diameter message, it delegates the handling of it to a diam.HandlerFunc. The code for these handlers was identical, except that a different function was being invoked to construct the response. This factors out the code so that the duplication is removed which will make it easier to implement handlers for more types of messages.

    Ignore empty flow stats reply in enforcement_stats (#161)
    
    Summary:
    Pull Request resolved: https://github.com/facebookexternal/magma/pull/161
    
    Previously, when `enforcement_stats` receives stat reply with no stats in it, it would reset current usage, resulting in reporting the total usage on the next poll, instead of the delta usage.
    
    This issue occurs when other apps (such as `meter_stats` when there are no subscribers, testing app) sends a stats request that would result in an empty reply.
    
    This diff fixes the issue by ignoring the stats reply if there are no stat inside, since there is nothing to reply anyways.

    Summary: Previously, if the HSS failed to access subscriber data, it would always return an error code indicating that the subscriber was unknown. This changes the HSS to check that the error is an UnknownSubscriberError before return an unknown subscriber error. If the error isn't an UnknownSubscriberError, then the HSS now outputs a transient error indicating that the request can be retried at a later time.

    Add custom auth errors for responding to authentication information requests
    
    Summary: When replying to authentication information requests (AIRs) with error messages, the HSS should not just send diam.UnableToComply. Instead, it needs to send the error code specified in 3GPP TS 29.272 section 5.2.3.1.3. This change adds two new kinds of custom auth errors, so that when the HSS needs to pick which error message to send, it has sufficient information to send the correct error code.
